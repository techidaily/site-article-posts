You can check about the battery life one by watching videos and the second is with web browsing. The better one is watching videos as it eats up more battery and is easy to find about the battery life.

Most of the tablets come between 8GB and 64GB which is small than desktops. So if you are planning to store high-definition files and software then you need to find the higher capacity tablet.</p><h4 id="Size-and-weight"><a href="#Size-and-weight" class="headerlink" title="Size and weight"></a>Size and weight</h4><p>Most of the time you must be carrying the tablet in your hands so checking the size and weight is important because you don’t want the device to be heavy for you. The lighter is better so check the size and weight while purchasing to make your hands burden-free.</p><h4 id="Budget"><a href="#Budget" class="headerlink" title="Budget"></a>Budget</h4><p>Every buying decision starts from deciding the budget at first so while picking any tablet you need to keep in mind your purchase limit so that you can make a list of those which are under your budget and on that basis you can choose the best tablet for photo editing.</p><h4 id="Display"><a href="#Display" class="headerlink" title="Display"></a>Display</h4><p>So display should be given priority as well while buying any tablet-like size of the display, resolution, brightness, coating, view angle, etc. things.

In this article, you will understand everything about this feature and how to enable this feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/the-firefox-picture-in-picture-mode-1.jpg"                      alt="the firefox"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-Picture-in-Picture-Mode-Works"><a href="#Part-1-How-Picture-in-Picture-Mode-Works" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How Picture-in-Picture Mode Works"></a>Part 1. How Picture-in-Picture Mode Works</h2><p>Picture-in-Picture allows for simple tab navigation without interfering with the video you are viewing. Enabling this feature allows your videos to play in a tiny overlay utilizing a separate video player. Users may move, resize and even pin the player on the screen. You may even switch between tabs without interfering with video playing.</p><p>The interface has a play&#x2F;pause button. You may also recover a video by locating it as well as close the interface by clicking the close button if you wish to. It will return to the initial tab and continue from where it left off when the player was closed.</p><p>When your video is in picture-in-picture mode, the video placeholder also displays on the website. “This video is playing in Picture-in-Picture mode,” it reads.</p><p>Using keyboard shortcuts, you can make adjustments for loudness but not for the video quality. However, you may make these adjustments from the original web page of the film. Also, keep in mind that any modifications to its initial position will affect the floating player. The video will immediately disappear when you refresh or open a new website in that tab.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-activate-Picture-in-Picture-PiP-in-Firefox"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-activate-Picture-in-Picture-PiP-in-Firefox" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

How to activate Picture-in-Picture (PiP) in Firefox</h2><p>Firefox is often considered one of the most data-protective browsers, but that is not all. Mozilla Firefox also comes with a variety of useful tools and features. It even incorporates certain features you can only find through extensions in other browsers.</p><p>Firefox, like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and other current browsers, supports picture-in-picture mode. This functionality allows you to view movies in a floating window while working with other tabs, browsers, desktop apps, and so on.</p><p>Because this picture-in-picture panel is an overlay, you may move it to any part of your screen. So, in picture-in-picture mode, you may click play&#x2F;pause, shut it, or expand it to its full size.</p><h3 id="Step-by-step-Guide-to-Enable-Firefox-Picture-in-Picture-Mode"><a href="#Step-by-step-Guide-to-Enable-Firefox-Picture-in-Picture-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Step-by-step Guide to Enable Firefox Picture-in-Picture Mode"></a>Step-by-step Guide to Enable Firefox Picture-in-Picture Mode</h3><p>Without the assistance of third-party add-on modules, PiP mode is a feasible choice. The picture-in-picture (PiP) mode option in the Firefox browser is activated by default. However, if this does not work, you can easily re-enable the option in the Firefox browser’s Settings area.</p><p>Here’s how to activate picture-in-picture video control in Firefox**:**</p><ol><li><strong>To start</strong>, locate and open the Firefox browser on your PC.</li><li>Click on the 3 horizontal lines in the top-right menu.</li><li>Choose the <strong>Options&#x2F;Settings</strong> from the menu list.

Whenever you visit a streaming site, a symbol for pip mode appears as an overlay on the video screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/the-firefox-picture-in-picture-mode-4.jpg"                      alt="the firefox picture in picture symbol"                ></p><p>You can load only a single video using the above guideline.

The video is repositioned to the side of the web page.</li><li>Repeat the preceding steps on the same page or in a separate tab to open several movies.</li><li>Firefox plays the new video above the first. Drag and drop it anywhere to display both.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/the-firefox-picture-in-picture-mode-5.jpg"                      alt="the new video above the first"                ></p><p>By following these steps, videos appear on the screen at the same time. For all tabs containing open videos, the main Firefox window shows a “play” symbol. Even if you dismiss Firefox, numerous videos will continue to play in other programs or on your desktop.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Disable-the-Picture-in-Picture-Mode"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Disable-the-Picture-in-Picture-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

However, not many people know what the term means. In addition, identifying sources for public domain art can be challenging if you are unaware of what these creative works entail.</p><p>Here is a full overview of public domain art, including how to find royalty-free art for your creations. Furthermore, you will find answers to the most frequently asked questions concerning royalty-free art.</p><ol><li><a href="#part1-1">what are public domain arts</a></li><li><a href="#part1-2">What is the copyright policy of famous art in history</a></li><li><a href="#part1-3">Can you use them for free</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part2">Best Official Public Domain Art websites recommendations</a></li></ul><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Public Domain Pictures</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-2">Wikimedia Commons</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-3">The New York Public Library Digital Collections</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-4">Flickr Commons</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">Best Public Domain Art Search Engine</a></li></ul><ol><li><a href="#part3-1">Artvee.com</a>  </li><li><a href="#part3-2">Museo</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part4">FAQ</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part1-What-is-Public-Domain-Artwork"><a href="#Part1-What-is-Public-Domain-Artwork" class="headerlink" title="Part1: What is Public Domain Artwork?"></a>Part1: What is Public Domain Artwork?</h2><p>Did you know that not all items you find on the internet are public domain? For example, regardless of the source, you cannot use someone’s street art in your commercial campaigns without their consent. In addition, different artists offer their work under various licenses, each with its unique usage requirements. For example, artwork under the Creative Commons license is free to use for personal and commercial purposes.</p><p>However, not all platforms offer the license information freely. Therefore, here is some information to help you identify royalty-free art you can use for your creative projects.</p><h3 id="So-what-are-public-domain-arts"><a href="#So-what-are-public-domain-arts" class="headerlink" title="So, what are public domain arts?"></a>So, what are public domain arts?</h3><p>Public domain arts are any creation out of copyright, meaning you can use it hassle-free. In addition, public domain arts span various creations, including graffiti, video mash-ups, songs, images, and paintings. Furthermore, most government copyright offices do not list public domain arts on their websites.</p><p>However, the following are the determining factors for work to become public domain.</p><p><strong>The copyright protection is expired</strong></p><p>Any work between 50 and 70 years old after the author’s death is public domain art. However, the copyright expiry can vary between countries. Therefore, familiarize yourself with your country’s copyright policy before using such works.</p><p><strong>The art does not meet the requirements for copyright protection</strong></p><p>In many countries, recipes, facts, and calendar dates do not qualify for copyright protection. However, you can face legal action if they include original descriptions and artwork. For example, reposting the images from last year’s calendar is a violation if a professional photographer does them.</p><p>In addition, some countries do not consider government documents as copyright items. For example, planet photos and videos from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration are <a class="link"   href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/index.html" >public domain art <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, meaning you can use them freely for commercial and personal creations.</p><h3 id="What-is-the-copyright-policy-of-famous-art-in-history"><a href="#What-is-the-copyright-policy-of-famous-art-in-history" class="headerlink" title="What is the copyright policy of famous art in history?"></a>What is the copyright policy of famous art in history?</h3><p>As mentioned above, you cannot rely on copyright websites to determine if your desired art is royalty-free, especially when the artist’s work is unpublished. However, the following tips can be useful in helping you avoid copyright violations. Kindly note that the tips below are for your general knowledge, and you should not rely on them as legal expert advice.</p><ol><li>All work published before January 1st, 1923 is public domain art. However, famous art between 75 and 100 years old may have copyright extensions, which can affect their usage in other projects. Therefore, you should check with the current owner to determine whether they are royalty-free art.</li><li>You can freely use your photo of famous paintings, drawings, and sculptures if they are an exact reproduction of the public domain artwork. This is because you automatically earn the copyright since the photo includes elements of your originality, such as the camera angle and post-production techniques.</li><li>You can not use a third-party photo of public domain art if the resulting image is a derivative. This is because the law recognizes the creator as the author and copyright owner. As such, you must have verifiable permission before using their work in your creations.</li><li>Not all items without a © are in the public domain. This is because modern video editing software allows you to remove copyright symbols from different works. Therefore, always perform a reverse image search when unsure of the photo’s origins.</li></ol><h3 id="Can-you-use-them-for-free"><a href="#Can-you-use-them-for-free" class="headerlink" title="Can you use them for free?"></a>Can you use them for free?</h3><p>Yes. You can use royalty-free art for whatever purpose you see fit. For example, you can reproduce the text and illustrations from the original version of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland (1865) because they are in the public domain.</p><p>However, the reproduction of the 1951 version by Walt Disney is a copyright violation since it is a derivative of the original version. In addition, The Walt Disney Company owns the trademark for all the derivatives, including the movie, cartoon characters, and merchandise.</p><h2 id="Part2-Best-Official-Public-Domain-Art-websites-recommendations"><a href="#Part2-Best-Official-Public-Domain-Art-websites-recommendations" class="headerlink" title="Part2: Best Official Public Domain Art websites recommendations"></a>Part2: Best Official Public Domain Art websites recommendations</h2><p>Now that you know what constitutes being in the public domain, where can you find public domain creative assets?

Royalty-free art refers to work that has no recurring payments to the author. However, it may contain usage restrictions depending on the source website. For example, you may need to make a one-time payment to download the image.</p><p>Conversely, public domain art is copyright free and does not require you to make any payments to use it.

For example, regardless of the source, you cannot use someone’s street art in your commercial campaigns without their consent. In addition, different artists offer their work under various licenses, each with its unique usage requirements. For example, artwork under the Creative Commons license is free to use for personal and commercial purposes.</p><p>However, not all platforms offer the license information freely. Therefore, here is some information to help you identify royalty-free art you can use for your creative projects.</p><h3 id="So-what-are-public-domain-arts-1"><a href="#So-what-are-public-domain-arts-1" class="headerlink" title="So, what are public domain arts?"></a>So, what are public domain arts?</h3><p>Public domain arts are any creation out of copyright, meaning you can use it hassle-free. In addition, public domain arts span various creations, including graffiti, video mash-ups, songs, images, and paintings. Furthermore, most government copyright offices do not list public domain arts on their websites.</p><p>However, the following are the determining factors for work to become public domain.</p><p><strong>The copyright protection is expired</strong></p><p>Any work between 50 and 70 years old after the author’s death is public domain art. However, the copyright expiry can vary between countries. Therefore, familiarize yourself with your country’s copyright policy before using such works.</p><p><strong>The art does not meet the requirements for copyright protection</strong></p><p>In many countries, recipes, facts, and calendar dates do not qualify for copyright protection. However, you can face legal action if they include original descriptions and artwork. For example, reposting the images from last year’s calendar is a violation if a professional photographer does them.</p><p>In addition, some countries do not consider government documents as copyright items. For example, planet photos and videos from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration are <a class="link"   href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/index.html" >public domain art <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, meaning you can use them freely for commercial and personal creations.</p><h3 id="What-is-the-copyright-policy-of-famous-art-in-history-1"><a href="#What-is-the-copyright-policy-of-famous-art-in-history-1" class="headerlink" title="What is the copyright policy of famous art in history?"></a>What is the copyright policy of famous art in history?</h3><p>As mentioned above, you cannot rely on copyright websites to determine if your desired art is royalty-free, especially when the artist’s work is unpublished. However, the following tips can be useful in helping you avoid copyright violations. Kindly note that the tips below are for your general knowledge, and you should not rely on them as legal expert advice.</p><ol><li>All work published before January 1st, 1923 is public domain art. However, famous art between 75 and 100 years old may have copyright extensions, which can affect their usage in other projects. Therefore, you should check with the current owner to determine whether they are royalty-free art.</li><li>You can freely use your photo of famous paintings, drawings, and sculptures if they are an exact reproduction of the public domain artwork. This is because you automatically earn the copyright since the photo includes elements of your originality, such as the camera angle and post-production techniques.</li><li>You can not use a third-party photo of public domain art if the resulting image is a derivative. This is because the law recognizes the creator as the author and copyright owner. As such, you must have verifiable permission before using their work in your creations.</li><li>Not all items without a © are in the public domain. This is because modern video editing software allows you to remove copyright symbols from different works. Therefore, always perform a reverse image search when unsure of the photo’s origins.</li></ol><h3 id="Can-you-use-them-for-free-1"><a href="#Can-you-use-them-for-free-1" class="headerlink" title="Can you use them for free?"></a>Can you use them for free?</h3><p>Yes. You can use royalty-free art for whatever purpose you see fit. For example, you can reproduce the text and illustrations from the original version of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland (1865) because they are in the public domain.</p><p>However, the reproduction of the 1951 version by Walt Disney is a copyright violation since it is a derivative of the original version. In addition, The Walt Disney Company owns the trademark for all the derivatives, including the movie, cartoon characters, and merchandise.</p><h2 id="Part2-Best-Official-Public-Domain-Art-websites-recommendations-1"><a href="#Part2-Best-Official-Public-Domain-Art-websites-recommendations-1" class="headerlink" title="Part2: Best Official Public Domain Art websites recommendations"></a>Part2: Best Official Public Domain Art websites recommendations</h2><p>Now that you know what constitutes being in the public domain, where can you find public domain creative assets?

The TV in your living room or conference room may be projected from your laptop or desktop, in other words.</li><li>Similar to the subtitle feature seen on other applications like Skype, this feature allows you to have the dialogue show in text on your screen in real-time so that you can more easily understand what is being said during video chats. It is exclusively offered in English. Click Turn on Captions in the Meet’s bottom right corner to turn it on.</li><li>Users of Google Meet will be able to pin many individuals to the top of their tiled screen.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="A-Comprehensive-Approach-to-Online-Advertising-Mastery"><a href="#A-Comprehensive-Approach-to-Online-Advertising-Mastery" class="headerlink" title="A Comprehensive Approach to Online Advertising Mastery"></a>A Comprehensive Approach to Online Advertising Mastery</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/become-a-successful-smm-in-10-steps-1.jpg"                      alt="introduction"                ></p><p>Within the world of social media marketing, there are many different strategies. All of these options can make it easy to feel overwhelmed.</p><p>But don’t worry! We’ve got some tried-and-true tips that can help you get started on your SMM journey.</p><h2 id="What-is-social-media-marketing-SMM"><a href="#What-is-social-media-marketing-SMM" class="headerlink" title="What is social media marketing (SMM)?"></a>What is social media marketing (SMM)?</h2><p>Social media marketing (SMM) typically refers to the use of online communities, social networks, and Internet media collaboration platforms to achieve marketing conversion through various methods, such as media promotion, attracting new users, and maintaining customer relationships.</p><p>Social media marketing, a key battleground for new media marketing, has also provided new impetus to companies involved in traditional marketing and a boost in marketing behavior.</p><p>So, how does a successful social media marketing campaign get planned and executed? Take a look at the ten ideas below.</p><p><strong>1. Design Your Strategies</strong></p><p>You need to follow several steps to become a successful SMM. First, define your goals and objectives. Doing this will determine what kind of content you need and if it is likely to help you reach your goals.</p><p>After defining your goals and objectives, brainstorm some ideas for content that aligns with these objectives. Then set a schedule for creating this content so it can be published on time—and ensure it’s consistent!</p><p>Next up: define your target audience so that every piece of content resonates with this audience—it should also be aligned with their values&#x2F;beliefs&#x2F;needs&#x2F;desires (whatever they may be).</p><p>Once these things are decided, develop strategies for each social media platform based on the type of information shared (i.e., text vs. photo vs. gif vs. video).</p><p><strong>2. Starting Live Broadcast</strong></p><p>Because it allows you to connect with your audience in real time, live streaming is one of the most popular social media marketing tools. It will allow them to interact with you and become involved in your business.</p><p>If done, live streaming can be a good way to increase brand awareness, build trust and improve customer service for your target audience.</p><p>What You’ll Need:</p><ul><li>A camera or phone that supports live streaming (or a laptop) - You can use any device with a camera built-in or connected via a USB cable (webcam). A phone will work, too, if it supports live streaming through its camera app.</li><li>When using a laptop, ensure there’s no glare from windows or lights behind you; otherwise, this could mess up how well people can see what’s happening on screen when watching via computer&#x2F;laptop screen-sharing software such as Skype or Beamr (see below).</li></ul><p><strong>3. Social Media Influencer</strong></p><p>Social media influencer is a term used to describe a person who significantly impacts consumers’ purchasing decisions.</p><p>Influencers can be celebrities and well-known public figures, but they can also be regular people with large followers and engagement on social media.</p><p>Influencers can be paid or unpaid, but most receive compensation for their posts&#x2F;content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/become-a-successful-smm-in-10-steps-2.jpg"                      alt="social media influencer"                ></p><p><strong>4. Create Subscription Options</strong></p><p>Subscription options are one of the best features of social media marketing. People who subscribe to your channel will be notified via email about all new posts you make on that channel. The subscriber can then choose to accept or decline the notification.</p><p>To create a subscription option:</p><ul><li>Navigate to “Customize” on the top right corner of your page and select “Subscription Options” from the dropdown menu.</li><li>Enter your desired name and description, then click “Save Changes” at the bottom of this section</li><li>To set up a subscription:</li></ul><p><strong>5. Engage with your Audience</strong></p><p>Engaging with your audience is a great way to keep them coming back and to ensure that your content is relevant. Here are some ways you can engage with your audience:</p><ul><li>Respond to comments in real-time. Responding to comments on social media is a great way to get immediate feedback from your community, show them that they’re being heard, and start discussions around topics they care about.</li><li>Answer questions in the comments section of your posts or videos.</li><li>Ask for feedback on new products or services you are launching. This can be as simple as asking what customers want you to create next!</li></ul><p><strong>6. Create User Generated Content</strong></p><p>It’s important to remember that social media is about the community, so it’s important to encourage your audience members to create content.</p><p>If you’re not getting user-generated content (UGC) on your website or blog, you’re losing out on a lot of potential traffic and engagement. Luckily, there are plenty of ways you can make sure that UGC happens:</p><ul><li>Encourage your followers to share images that relate to your brand or products using hashtags such as #yourbrandname and #yourproductsname. This will help people find those posts later when searching for related content.</li><li>If someone posts something valuable on your platforms (Twitter, Instagram), comment and thank them for their contribution! It shows appreciation for their time and effort in creating something useful for others.</li></ul><p><strong>7. Create a Positive Brand Image</strong></p><p>Create a positive brand image. The first thing you want to do is create a positive brand image for yourself and your company. This will help you stand out from the competition and set yourself up for success in all areas of social marketing, especially on social media, where people constantly look for new products or services to try out.</p><p>Use the right words and images. The best way to convey this is through your website’s design, which should be clean, easy to navigate (especially on mobile), simple in style, but modern enough that it looks good with everything else being made today.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/become-a-successful-smm-in-10-steps-3.jpg"                      alt="create a positive brand image"                ></p><p>It’s a good idea to choose a domain name that matches your business name precisely, so there’s no confusion when people visit it online. Or you could go for something generic but memorable like.</p><p><strong>8. Create a Content Plan for your Brand</strong></p><p>The first step in creating a successful SMM strategy is to create a content plan. You can create a content calendar to help you stay on track and be more efficient in your efforts.</p><p>Content planning is important for SMM because it will help you stay focused on what needs to be done, how much time each task takes, and who should do it. The result of having a sound content plan will be an increase in productivity and efficiency while also allowing you to stay on track with your goals.</p><p><strong>9. Keep an Eye on Competition and Trends</strong></p><p>Monitor your competitors and be aware of what is happening in the industry. Take advantage of social media to keep up with industry trends and find out what your audience is interested in. Social media can also help you determine what your competition is doing.</p><p><strong>10. Participate in Social Media Events</strong></p><p>Social media events can be a great way to get your name out there and promote your brand.</p><ul><li>They are a good way to get new leads.</li><li>You can also use social media events to build your brand’s reputation.</li></ul><h2 id="BONUS-Just-keep-sending-out-a-message"><a href="#BONUS-Just-keep-sending-out-a-message" class="headerlink" title="BONUS: Just keep sending out a message"></a>BONUS: Just keep sending out a message</h2><p>One of the most important things to remember is that consistency is the key. You need to be constantly promoting yourself, not just every so often. Don’t just post a message once and assume that people will see it and buy from you because they won’t!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/become-a-successful-smm-in-10-steps-4.jpg"                      alt="bonus just keep sending out message"                ></p><p>It should be easy for people to find you on social media if they want to buy your products or services. You have to keep sending out messages and posting updates until they do!</p><p>Social media can be hard work sometimes but don’t give up hope; if you keep trying, it will eventually pay off!</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>So, there you have it, our top tips for succeeding in social media marketing.</p><p>We hope this post has given you some ideas of how to get started with your SMM strategy and that it has given you some valuable insights into what makes a successful one.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-educational-transformation-the-vr-revolution/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Educational Transformation  The VR Revolution</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/new-setup-guide-connect-obs-and-streamlabs-on-your-mac/"><u>[New] Setup Guide  Connect OBS and Streamlabs on Your Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/new-become-a-viral-meme-magician-with-9gag-techniques/"><u>[New] Become a Viral Meme Magician with 9GAG Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-top-10-apps-for-live-sports-and-football-streaming/"><u>[New] In 2024, Top 10 Apps for Live Sports & Football Streaming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-beginners-guide-to-visual-storytelling-key-shot-techniques/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Beginner’s Guide to Visual Storytelling  Key Shot Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/updated-sdr-to-hdri-step-by-step-video-enhancement-guide-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] SDR to HDRI  Step-by-Step Video Enhancement Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/updated-hidden-whatsapp-gems-top-tricks-to-enhance-your-messaging-experience/"><u>[Updated] Hidden WhatsApp Gems  Top Tricks to Enhance Your Messaging Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-boosting-skypes-performance-with-advanced-zoom-functionalities/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Boosting Skype's Performance with Advanced Zoom Functionalities</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/2024-approved-uniting-disparate-iphone-media-into-one-feed/"><u>2024 Approved  Uniting Disparate iPhone Media Into One Feed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-achieve-peak-performance-enhancing-gameplay-using-switch-pro-controller-in-steam-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Achieve Peak Performance  Enhancing Gameplay Using Switch Pro Controller in Steam for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-translation.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-how-to-translate-youtube-videos-to-english-subtitles/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved How to Translate YouTube Videos to English Subtitles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-to-stop-my-spouse-from-spying-on-my-infinix-smart-8-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Stop My Spouse from Spying on My Infinix Smart 8 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-iphone-15-plus-without-passcode-4-easy-methods-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How To Unlock iPhone 15 Plus Without Passcode?

You can use any <strong>zoom-in online</strong> app or website to zoom or adjust the dimensions and size of your videos and photos in seconds. Zooming means enlarging any photo in a way that the photo details become more apparent and visible. Zooming photos have several broad uses, from zooming any photo online to zooming via your camera lens, etc.</p><p>People often need to zoom videos and photos to enlarge pictures without damaging their resolution. The photo’s resolution also determines if you zoom the photo without compromising the quality. Moreover, the photos and videos are enlarged using Artificial Intelligence and machine learning technology, permitting you to produce high-resolution images.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Zoom-Photo-Online"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Zoom-Photo-Online" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How to Zoom Photo Online?"></a>Part 1. How to Zoom Photo Online?</h2><p>LunaPic is an entirely free-of-charge photo zoom editing website. It is developed in a manner that’d remind its users of a former photo editing Windows application.

You’re certainly not looking to drop thousands of dollars on one. Fortunately, there are some affordable options available to you.</p><h2 id="1-Ricoh-Theta-S"><a href="#1-Ricoh-Theta-S" class="headerlink" title="1. Ricoh Theta S"></a>1. Ricoh Theta S</h2><p>First, an offering from Ricoh, the Ricoh Theta S. This pocket-sized camera costs around $350 and is super simple to use. It has exactly one button for taking photos or videos. The camera can connect via USB or HDMI, but is also Wi-Fi capable, allowing you to transfer footage to your iPhone. This camera shoots at 14 megapixels, and 30 fps. There are several apps associated with it: one allowing you to edit your videos, as well as one that acts as a live-view feed and remote control to make shooting even easier.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/affordable-360-camera-ricoh-theta-s.jpg"                      alt="affordable 360 camera - Ricoh Theta S"                ></p><p><strong>Related article:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Full review for Ricoh Theta S &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="2-360fly-4K"><a href="#2-360fly-4K" class="headerlink" title="2. 360fly 4K"></a>2. 360fly 4K</h2><p>The 360fly 4k is a slightly more expensive option, retailing around $500. Unlike many other 360-degree cameras, it has only a single lens to capture its video, meaning that there is no stitching together of two images to create a seamless image. Like the Ricoh camera, it offers an app, 360fly, to connect to your iOS device and act as a remote control. A second app, Livit, is offered to allow live streaming of your videos, along with editing. The 360fly camera is heavier duty than some of the other options out there, with water, dust, and shock-resistant body. It also offers a great image, with 2880x2880 resolution, 30fps, and a 240-degree vertical field of view. It also has some built-in sensors, including a barometer, accelerometer, and a GPS sensor.</p><p>Check this video to watch the 360fly 4k unboxing review:</p><h2 id="3-Giroptic"><a href="#3-Giroptic" class="headerlink" title="3. Giroptic"></a>3. Giroptic</h2><p>Giroptic also makes a 360-degree camera, simply named the Giroptic 360cam, that retails for about $500. This camera uses 3 fisheye lenses and combines images into a 360-degree whole in real-time. It has three built-in microphones to capture sound and a gyroscope and accelerometer to stabilize images for videos, photo bursts, and other types of footage. It offers slightly less resolution for video, about 2K at 30fps, but 4K for still images. The 360cam app, for iOS, lets you remotely control the camera over Wi-Fi, but also lets you view, edit and share photos and videos.</p><p><strong>Related article:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Full review for Giroptic &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Have a quick review on Giroptic from this video:</p><h2 id="4-Kodak-PixPro-SP360-4K"><a href="#4-Kodak-PixPro-SP360-4K" class="headerlink" title="4. Kodak PixPro SP360 4K"></a>4. Kodak PixPro SP360 4K</h2><p>Kodak, one of the older names in photography, offers the Kodak PixPro SP360 4K Action Cam. It relies on a dome-shaped, fixed focus 235-degree lens to capture 360-degree video. Starting at $449 from Kodak, this camera isn’t excessively expensive, though it’s also not the cheapest offering. It shoots 2880x2880 video at 30 fps. It can also shoot stills at resolutions up to 8MP. While not the best image quality among the camera offerings, Kodak’s camera is tough – resistant to water, dust, and shocks – making it a good choice if you find yourself on adventures where being careful with your precious camera isn’t always your first priority.</p><p>A wonderful day with PixPro SP360 4K:</p><h2 id="5-LG360-cam"><a href="#5-LG360-cam" class="headerlink" title="5. LG360 cam"></a>5. LG360 cam</h2><p>The LG360 cam retails for around $200, making it one of the cheapest phones on the market, and was designed to work with the company’s G5 smartphone, though it also works with an iPhone. It captures 2K, 360-degree video, and 5.1 channel surround sound, as well as allowing you to use only one of its two lenses for 180-degree image capture. It’s a small camera with no built-in display, but the companion app acts as a remote control and lets you view your recording in real-time.</p><p>Check a detailed review about LG360 Cam from this video</p><h2 id="6-ALLie-Camera"><a href="#6-ALLie-Camera" class="headerlink" title="6. ALLie Camera"></a>6. ALLie Camera</h2><p>The ALLie Camera retails for $499 and uses two fisheye lenses to take its 4096x2048 video. One interesting feature is the 10 built-in infrared LEDs that allow you to film in dark environments with a full 360-degree view. Its integrated microphone and speaker allows two-way audio so that users can communicate. Its app lets you view the footage from anywhere and, if your mobile device has gyroscopic motion sensors, change your perspective while viewing footage by tilting and moving the screen. In addition to the app, recording and playback is available through the subscription-based ALLieCam Cloud.</p><p>Check a detailed review about Allie Camera from this video</p><h2 id="7-Panono"><a href="#7-Panono" class="headerlink" title="7. Panono"></a>7. Panono</h2><p>Panono, a spherical camera retailing for around $549 is unique in using 36 lenses to take 108 MP photos and videos, avoiding the use of wide-angle lenses. It can be thrown safely, as well as supporting a universal mounting system. Final stitching together of the many images into a coherent photo or video requires sending the files to a cloud device, but the image quality more than makes up for it.</p><p>Check this video to see how to take 360 pictures with Panono:</p><h2 id="8-Centr"><a href="#8-Centr" class="headerlink" title="8. Centr"></a>8. Centr</h2><p>Centr, a 360-degree cam funded on Kickstarter, retails for $399 and uses 4 110-degree lenses to capture its video. It has built-in image stitching technology, meaning that users don’t need to use a desktop app or a cloud service to view the final video. It takes 20 MP photos and 4K video at 60 fps.</p><p>Check a detailed review about Centr 360 camera:</p><h2 id="9-Bublcam"><a href="#9-Bublcam" class="headerlink" title="9. Bublcam"></a>9. Bublcam</h2><p>One of the most expensive cameras in this line-up at around $800, Bublcam uses 4 110-degree lenses to take spherical photos and videos. Taking 14 MP images and 1080p video, it’s a hit with photographers for image quality. In addition to this, it has stabilization features activated when the camera is in motion, to keep shaky camera work from ruining your video.</p><p><strong>Related article:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Full review for Bublecam &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Bublcam’s unboxing review:</p><h2 id="10-Nikon-Key-Mission-360"><a href="#10-Nikon-Key-Mission-360" class="headerlink" title="10. Nikon Key Mission 360"></a>10. Nikon Key Mission 360</h2><p>Finally, Nikon’s upcoming Key Mission 360 camera is built for action. It’s a pocket-sized device with dual lenses, and it’s meant to be rugged. Nikon advertises that it will be waterproof to 100 feet, and stand up to dust, shock, and cold. The app uses a simple swipe interface to let you get a panoramic view of everything you recorded. The expected retail price is $499.</p><p>See more details about Nikon Key Mission 360 camera from this video:</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>These 10 options are only some of the 360-degree cameras that are upcoming or already on the consumer market. Most of them cost a bit more than a new phone and shoot a pretty nice video. While the video and images can be enjoyed on your computer screen, VR headsets come highly recommended for getting the full effect.

So if you are thinking to buy a new camera for your adventurous tours then you need to make a careful decision out of all existing competitive brands. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Xiaomi YI 4K <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is one of the highly rated action camera under this competing category.

Both of these are compared in detail as below:</p><h4 id="1-Hardware"><a href="#1-Hardware" class="headerlink" title="1.Hardware"></a>1.Hardware</h4><p><strong>Touch Screen:</strong> When displays of both these cameras are compared then it was observed that YI 4K provides better response as compared to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >GoPro Hero5 Black <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Size of display is also larger in case of YI 4K as it goes up to 2.19” whereas Hero5 has 2” screen. The Touch Screen is found more interactive in YI 4K whereas in case of Hero5 you may need to press twice especially when it is wet. The front LCD display of GoPro provides additional settings menu for easy control.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/yi-4k-touchscreen.jpg"                      alt="Yi 4K action camera touchscreen"                ></p><p> Image source:elproducente.com</p><p><strong>Waterproof:</strong> The biggest benefit of GoPro Hero5 is that it can serve you underwater but YI 4K cannot as you need additional protective case for this camera. But you cannot save your recordings from handling noise in case of GoPro unit. When you go underwater with YI 4K while using protective housing then it is not possible to use its touch screen feature and secondly the audio quality decays by large extent.</p><p><strong>Battery Life:</strong> Both of these camera units come with removable batteries but in case of Hero5 you can enjoy recording only up to 1hr 40 minutes with its 1220mAh battery backup whereas the YI 4K camera is developed with 1400mAh battery that can serve perfectly for 2 hours. Prefer to use these cameras with WiFi connections turned off in order to save battery for longer duration.</p><h4 id="2-Performance"><a href="#2-Performance" class="headerlink" title="2.Performance"></a>2.Performance</h4><p><strong>Image Resolution:</strong> Photo quality of both cameras is 12MP and digital image stabilization feature is added to both units. You can find much warmer and smoother quality with Yi 4K whereas GoPro offers services for RAW photography.</p><p><strong>Video Resolution:</strong> When we talk about the video resolution then different ratings must be compared to get better idea about performance. When we talk about Go Pro Hero5 then maximum video quality is offered to be 4K at 30fps, 2.7k at 60fps, 1080p with 120fps and 720p at 240fps. On the other side in case of Xiaomi YI 4K you will be able to avail 4K at 30fps, 2.5K at 30fps, 1440p with 60fps, 1080p for 120fps and 720p with 200fps only.</p><p><strong>Audio Quality:</strong> Audio Quality of GoPro Hero5 is rated to be much superior as compared to Yi 4K camera unit. The housing helps to protect Hero5 from wind noise but it can perform even better without housing as compared to Yi 4K. Hero5 Black comes with 3 microphones and it helps to make better selection for audio streams.</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> GoPro Hero5 can be ordered online with a payment of $399 but you will be glad to know that equally featured Xiaomi Yi Action Camera is cheaper as well as affordable with a price tag of $199.99 only. When we compare specs and hardware of both these cameras then Yi 4K is observed to provide all desired high performance results while meeting all needs of sports persons so you can think of buying Xiaomi product that falls in your budget.</p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p> Almost all features are discussed above and it is observed that if you are searching for a camera to record videos underwater or in rainy seasons then it is best idea to invest on GoPro Hero5 but in case of other adventurous sports activities Yi 4K can also provide you impressive results and it is a fit to budget camera unit.

Tip 6: Use Blend IF"></a>6. Tip 6: Use Blend IF</h3><p>If you want to change the color of leaves on a tree, you can use the “Blend IF” option of Adobe Photoshop to precisely do the changes. Start with duplicating the existing layer and then hiding the second layer. Double click on the layer to open the menu and then use “Blend IF” sliders. This option works when you drag the sliders to black points, and it automatically hides the dark pixels of your photo.</p><p>Similarly, if you drag the “Blend IF” sliders towards white pints, it can hide the light pixels. To hide any specific color from the picture, you can click on “Channels” and then select the color you want to eradicate completely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/change-photo-color-9.jpg"                      alt="select the channel color"                ></p><p>This method only hides color based on their luminance values; however, this loads the entire layer when loading the active pixels. Regardless, this can be changed into transparency. For this, you need to select the layer by right-clicking and selecting the option of “Convert to Smart Object.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/change-photo-color-10.jpg"                      alt="convert to smart object"                ></p><p>It helps the user create transparency across the layer. After hiding the layer and coming back to another object-specific layer, you can create a certain change in effect through adjustment layers. For instance, you can create a “Hue and Saturation” adjustment layer. With the above settings, Photoshop applies this as a layer mask for you. Use the sliders across the set layer to change the color across the selected areas.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/change-photo-color-11.jpg"                      alt="select your new color"                ></p><h3 id="7-Tip-7-Use-Online-Photo-Editor-to-Change-Colors"><a href="#7-Tip-7-Use-Online-Photo-Editor-to-Change-Colors" class="headerlink" title="7.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Achieving-Seamless-Video-Communication-Between-Xbox-Zoom"><a href="#Achieving-Seamless-Video-Communication-Between-Xbox-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="Achieving Seamless Video Communication Between Xbox &amp; Zoom"></a>Achieving Seamless Video Communication Between Xbox &amp; Zoom</h2><p>Zoom has been in the trend since the world witnessed Covid-19. Now gamers even want to experience video conferencing while playing their games. Unfortunately, there is no availability of <strong>zoom on Xbox one.</strong> Zoom is available on almost every platform and device, but for Xbox, it has some more time. It appears that Zoom won’t return to Xbox anytime soon, and competitiveness would be one of the primary causes.</p><p>Why would Microsoft let a third-party video chatting app since they already have successful ones of their own? What then seems to be in the Zoom? Players still want that on their Xbox despite the fact that it is unlikely to materialize anytime soon. Before going any further, how can I access Zoom meetings on Xbox One? Have a brief overview of Zoom’s capabilities to comprehend the pressing XBOX requirement better.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Is-Zoom-app-available-on-Xbox"><a href="#Part-1-Is-Zoom-app-available-on-Xbox" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Is Zoom app available on Xbox"></a>Part 1. Is Zoom app available on Xbox</h2><p>Zoom is one of the famous and user-friendly audio and video chat programs. It is a cloud-based app that allows the user to meet anyone online. Zoom is one of the best platforms to work from home. The world is using zoom for video conferencing at work from home. It is the best personal platform for video chats with friends and family. This app has the best features when it comes to virtual meetings or calls, and that’s why it has several users.</p><p>The Xbox network has a crucial part of the Xbox system. Users can use the web to purchase several games and watch videos and share their recorded videos. It allows their user to use skype for communication and keep track of their friends, game progress, and achievements. Users can even play their multiplayer games on Xbox with other players online.</p><p>Zoom has launched an application known as Zoom Room. This room is also a casting app that allows cast meetings from Mac, PC, or Xbox. So recently, the application was removed from the Xbox app. The only way of using <strong>Zoom meeting on Xbox one</strong> is through Screen Cast.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Get-Zoom-Meeting-on-Xbox-One-using-Chromecast"><a href="#Part-2-Get-Zoom-Meeting-on-Xbox-One-using-Chromecast" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Get Zoom Meeting on Xbox One using Chromecast"></a>Part 2. Get Zoom Meeting on Xbox One using Chromecast</h2><p>It is already mentioned that Zoom doesn’t support Xbox. You may be late because the XBOX has Zoom Rooms in their app store, which might help the users to get zoom meetings on the Xbox. But, recently, it got removed by Xbox from the App Store, which left Xbox gamers disconnected.</p><p>But there is nothing to worry about, and you might have heard the phrase “if there is a will, there is a way.” You can also get a zoom meeting i.e. on Xbox with another option. That way is known as Screen Casting. It is a straightforward method of <strong>using zoom on Xbox one</strong>, but most ignored by many of its users. Let’s look at how you can use a screencast by using Chromecast on the Xbox.</p><ul><li>For setting up a Zoom meeting i.e. on Xbox, at first, you will have to “plug in” Chromecast that is to Xbox One’s HDMI port.</li><li>Now, opt for moving to the Xbox Pins and then find the TV app; select to launch that application.</li><li>After choosing the TV app, you will be told to connect the satellite box or cable. You can tap on the “A” button on the remote to select the option.</li><li>After a few times, the Chromecast can get detected by Xbox One, which will appear in a small window. After that, at this point, the next button will get activated and once the button gets activated, click “Next.”</li><li>If you wish to set up the Xbox One for controlling the Casting Screen, tap on “Next.” If it is not, you can click on “Skip” and move to the next screen.</li><li>In the next window, choose what you wish to do after Xbox starts. You can select “On Start, Open TV or go home after it starts. After you select the option from the drop-down, you can now opt for clicking “Next” to complete the Chromecast setup.</li><li>After successful setup, switch back to the casting device, i.e., iPhone, Android, iPad, Mac, Laptop or Desktop, etc.</li><li>Now, opt to visit settings and then opt for clicking on the Cast.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-meeting-cast.jpg"                      alt="zoom meeting cast"                ></p><ul><li>At this point, the list of every installed device gets displayed on the device screen.</li><li>Now, opt for choosing Xbox One by choosing the gaming console name for casting the device’s screen on Xbox One.</li><li>You can now launch Zoom meetings or rooms on the device, which can then be cast directly to the Xbox One.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-Setup-Zoom-Conference-on-Xbox"><a href="#Part-3-Setup-Zoom-Conference-on-Xbox" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Setup Zoom Conference on Xbox"></a>Part 3. Setup Zoom Conference on Xbox</h2><p>It is one of the most used apps amongst applications available. This application helps people in their meetings, business meetings, or group meetings. Here are the steps to help you set up a zoom conference on Xbox.</p><ul><li>At first, opt for downloading the Zoom rooms to Android devices, PC, MAC, iPhones, and iPad to get started.</li><li>After the installation is done, you can open “The zoom app.” The zoom rooms are also available on the Xbox.</li><li>For linking your Xbox and device, opt for clicking on the option “Connect.”</li><li>Then, start your meeting by simply clicking on “Meet Now.”</li></ul><p>Furthermore, it is pretty similar to screencasting Zoom on Xbox. That’s how you can <strong>install zoom on Xbox one</strong> and use it without the Chromecast. Zoom apps can be used in Xbox in these stages.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The Xbox or Zoom app is one of the most popular apps for users.
