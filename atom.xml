    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="From-Standard-to-Spectacular-The-Journey-with-VCE-2-2"><a href="#From-Standard-to-Spectacular-The-Journey-with-VCE-2-2" class="headerlink" title="From Standard to Spectacular: The Journey with VCE 2.2"></a>From Standard to Spectacular: The Journey with VCE 2.2</h2><p>We’ve all experienced moments when the quality of a video isn’t as good as we’d like it to be. This is especially true; an unsteady hand, poor lighting, or low-quality technology can prevent all damage to a video.</p><p>You’re in luck if you’ve ever wondered how to improve video quality. We’re going to look over the finest video quality enhancers today. Many video enhancers have been launched so far, and you might find it difficult to choose one for you. Let’s begin:</p><h2 id="Video-enhancer-2-2"><a href="#Video-enhancer-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Video enhancer 2.2"></a>Video enhancer 2.2</h2><p>Video Enhancer is an application that uses the Super Resolution approach to boost video resolution. Super Resolution is a clever video upsizing method that uses information from neighboring frames to upsize the current frame. It gathers data. Therefore the more sequential frames processed, the greater the quality.</p><p>If the image in your video doesn’t change too quickly, information from multiple frames can be combined to create a larger image, showing details that would otherwise be concealed. However, no regular image resize&#x2F;resample techniques can achieve this quality because there isn’t enough information in one frame.</p><h3 id="How-to-use-Video-Enhancer-2-2"><a href="#How-to-use-Video-Enhancer-2-2" class="headerlink" title="How to use Video Enhancer 2.2?"></a>How to use Video Enhancer 2.2?</h3><p>Video Enhancers allow you to:</p><ul><li>Increase the resolution of your video with the Video Super-Resolution approach, which gives incredible quality by leveraging information from prior frames. At the same time, other resize methods only use information from one current frame. In addition, you may now convert SD video to HD!</li><li>Use VirtualDub’s hundreds of video filters to perform anything you want with your video, including deinterlacing, denoising, deshaking, color correction, sharpening, and visual effects.</li></ul><p>Because all filters and codecs function in independent threads, Video Enhancer is much faster than VirtualDub.</p><ul><li>Open any video that can be played on your system and re-compress it using any video codec (DirectShow, DMO, or Video for Windows) that you have installed.</li></ul><p>However, the step-by-step on how to use Video Enhancer 2.2</p><p><strong>Step 1: Import the file</strong></p><p>Download Video Enhancer 2.2 and launch the software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/video-enhancer-2-1.jpg"                      alt="video-enhancer-2-"                ></p><p>Once you have launched the software, import the file by clicking on ‘Browse’ to enhance video resolution.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Edit the file</strong></p><p>After uploading the video file, click on ‘Add a filter,’ and a pop-up window shows various editing options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/video-enhancer-2-2.jpg"                      alt="video-enhancer-2-"                ></p><p>You can create chains with any number of VirtualDub and Super Resolution filters to apply to your video in the Advanced user interface mode. You can filter your video before, after, in between, or even instead of scaling.</p><p>With over a hundred VirtualDub filters, you can edit your video, including deinterlace, denoise, deshake, color correction, visual effects, etc. Video Enhancer will most likely recognize your filters if you have VirtualDub installed.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Improve Video Resolution:</strong></p><p>Once you are done editing the video, close the pop-up window and click on ‘Add Super Resolution Resize’ and change the video resolution.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/video-enhancer-2-3.jpg"                      alt="video-enhancer-2-"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Save the edited video file</strong></p><p>Click the Save video to store or share your finished video if you’re satisfied with the outcome. You can also change the configuration of the output file by selecting your preferred video and audio compressing options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/video-enhancer-2-4.jpg"                      alt="video-enhancer-2-"                ></p><p>Video Enhancer will scan your system for 32-bit video and audio compressors and provide them in drop-down lists for you to choose from. If you have codecs from Video Enhancer’s favored list, it will advise which codec to use and at what bitrate. The recommended bitrate is determined by the final video resolution and the codec. After that, it displays its recommendations in the text; you must select the codecs and set the bitrate in its settings to finish the process.</p><h2 id="Alternative-ways-to-enhance-video"><a href="#Alternative-ways-to-enhance-video" class="headerlink" title="Alternative ways to enhance video"></a>Alternative ways to enhance video</h2><h3 id="1-Filmora"><a href="#1-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="1. Filmora"></a>1. Filmora</h3><p>Compatibility: Windows&#x2F;Mac</p><p>Wondershare Filmora is, without a doubt, the best video editor on the market, and it deserves to be at the top of our list.</p><p>In the Filmora video editor, you’ll find some professional tools to help you increase video quality and over 300 creative filters and effects to give your movie a new, fresh look without putting in a lot of effort. Apart from the features that allow you to adjust video rotation effortlessly, this program is one of the most dependable.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Import media files</strong></p><p>To access the primary editing interface, open Wondershare Filmora and select “New Project.” Then select “Import” to load files from your computer. You can also connect your devices by dragging and dropping files into the software or using the Import option. Filmora can handle images, video, and audio files with ease.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/video-enhancer-2-5.jpg"                      alt="video-enhancer-2-"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Enhance video quality</strong></p><p>Drag &amp; drop all the media files onto the timeline tracks after being imported into the application. Right-click on the media clip you want to improve and select “Edit.” Rotate, crop, speed, and adjust are just a few fundamental options. You may quickly adjust the contrast, saturation, brightness, and hue from this menu. It is less difficult to edit audio. Select the Audio column and adjust the settings as desired. You may change the output volume, fade in, fade out, and pitch.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/video-enhancer-2-6.jpg"                      alt="video-enhancer-2-"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Export and Share video</strong></p><p>Click the Play button to see a preview of the new video; once you’ve improved the video quality, select Export to store or share your finished video if you’re satisfied with the outcome. The Format tab allows you to encode the video into several video formats, or the Device tab allows you to export the video to common mobile pictures and portable devices. Finally, go to the DVD tab if you wish to burn a DVD. Additionally, you can post it online using the YouTube option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/video-enhancer-2-7.jpg"                      alt="video-enhancer-2-"                ></p><h3 id="2-iMovie"><a href="#2-iMovie" class="headerlink" title="2. iMovie"></a>2. iMovie</h3><p>Compatibility: macOS, iOS</p><p>Instead of paying hundreds of dollars on video editing tools, Mac users can use iMovie to edit their videos. The best thing is that the software works on iPhones, iPads, and Apple laptops, allowing you to edit your footage as soon as you take it.</p><p>iMovie supports 4K films and makes the editing process enjoyable and simple. You only need to arrange your clips on the timeline, choose background music, make opening titles and closing credits, or add interesting visual effects. Then, your videos are ready to be shared with the public.</p><p>You can use the following steps to enhance the video quality:</p><p>Step 1: Navigate to the project browser and choose the video clip you wish to modify. To begin the resizing process, click the crop button. You can also press the R key on your keyboard.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/video-enhancer-2-8.jpg"                      alt="video-enhancer-2-"                ></p><p>Step 2: Drag and resize your movie by dragging and repositioning the green rectangle. Stop pressing the resize button after you’re happy with the final size.</p><p>Step 3: View the video on the viewer to see how it looks after resizing.</p><h3 id="3-HDConvert"><a href="#3-HDConvert" class="headerlink" title="3.

Additionally, the platform provides a variety of export options, including the ability to change the resolution of your video files. There are no file size restrictions, so that you can upload any file to HDconvert, regardless of its size. However, huge video files may take some time to upload.</p><p>After the upload is complete, you can select various video resolutions, ranging from 240p to UHD 4K. If you wish to export your video files in Full HD, Ultra HD, or 4K resolution, you’ll need to upgrade to the premium edition of HDconvert. Furthermore, use the free version of HDconvert to modify the resolution of your videos. Unfortunately, you won’t be able to change the default  video codec to  video codec.</p><p>You can use the following steps to enhance the video quality:</p><p>Step 1: Go to HDconvert.com and press the button in the center to begin converting a file right away.</p><p>Step 2: To continue, upload a video file and select MP4 as the desired video format.</p><p>Step 3: Select Full HD 1080p as the output video quality if you’re on the premium plan. Aside from that, you can only convert video to HD 720P.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/video-enhancer-2-10.jpg"                      alt="video-enhancer-2-"                ></p><p>Step 4: Once the standard video has been converted to HD, download the video to your device as soon as possible because the download URL will expire in 24 hours.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/video-enhancer-2-11.jpg"                      alt="video-enhancer-2-"                ></p><h3 id="4-InShot"><a href="#4-InShot" class="headerlink" title="4.

A video trimmer, splitter, and merger, a plethora of filters and effects, speed controls, a video format converter, and an audio editor, are all included in InShot.</p><p>The app would appeal to social media addicts looking for a video quality enhancement.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="ASMR-A-Harmonious-Journey-to-Wellbe-Point"><a href="#ASMR-A-Harmonious-Journey-to-Wellbe-Point" class="headerlink" title="ASMR: A Harmonious Journey to Wellbe Point"></a>ASMR: A Harmonious Journey to Wellbe Point</h2><p><strong>Why is ASMR relaxing</strong>? As the globe becomes connected, new trends and fads emerge regularly. One of these developments is Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR), which has taken the world by storm in recent years. What began as a tiny community on sites such as YouTube has become a global sensation. Individuals of all ages (even celebrities!) are generating their own ASMR films on platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, and others.</p><p>But just what is ASMR? The experience differs from individual to individual, but the fundamental notion is the tingling feeling individuals get when exposed to specific noises such as whispering, tapping, and others. So <strong>why do people like ASMR</strong>? Read on to know.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/benefit-of-asmr-1.png"                      alt="benefits of asmr"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-do-People-like-ASMR"><a href="#Part-1-Why-do-People-like-ASMR" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why do People like ASMR?"></a>Part 1: Why do People like ASMR?</h2><p>Some individuals experience ASMR in response to various sensory “triggers.” It may be listening to someone talk or tapping or seeing someone brush their hair or folding their clothing with care and precision. It could also be particular noises like tapping or whispering. In addition, one of the most common triggers in ordinary life is a light touch, such as caressing someone’s arm or tracing one’s fingers on the back.</p><p>Here are some fundamental reasons <strong>why people like ASMR</strong>:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/benefit-of-asmr-2.png"                      alt="why people like asmr"                ></p><ul><li><strong>ASMR helps one cope with Stress &amp; Anxiety:</strong> Studies fund that ASMR assists people in dealing with stress and anxiety. One <a class="link"   href="https://asmruniversity.com/2018/06/26/asmr-research-survey-affect-physiology/" >2018 research <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> discovered that ASMR reduced stress, while another in 2017 discovered that 11% of individuals viewed ASMR videos mainly to assist them in coping with anxiety. Similarly, 2015 research found that 70% of its participants utilized ASMR films to cope with stress. It’s not just anecdotal evidence—research reveals that individuals who watch ASMR regularly report feeling happier and less stressed than those who don’t!</li><li><strong>It helps some people solve sleeping issues:</strong> If this is the case, you are not alone. Many individuals use ASMR as a sleep aid by many individuals. According to a <a class="link"   href="https://asmruniversity.com/2017/11/09/asmr-research-survey-personality-empathy-triggers/" >2017 study <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, 41% of individuals utilized ASMR to help them fall asleep. Another <a class="link"   href="https://asmruniversity.com/2015/04/04/peerj-peer-reviewed-research-asmr/" >2015 research <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> discovered that 82 percent of the subjects used ASMR to fall asleep because the videos are low-stress and calming. Because they generally center on relaxing sounds or sights, viewing ASMR videos might help you unwind after a busy day and prepare for the night.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Why-is-ASMR-Relaxing"><a href="#Part-2-Why-is-ASMR-Relaxing" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why is ASMR Relaxing?"></a>Part 2: Why is ASMR Relaxing?</h2><p>Another pertinent query relating to the above section would be <strong>why ASMR is relaxing</strong>. Here is a detailed and factual answer.</p><p>ASMR is a sense of quiet, relaxation, and comfort from viewing particular videos that often show someone executing a delicate job, such as speaking or tapping on things. These films visibly improve people’s tranquillity and help them fall asleep quicker. They also establish a bond between the maker of the video and the viewer. You can trace this behavior back to ancient times when individuals would listen to others tell tales to feel comfortable and at peace.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/benefits-of-asmr-3.jpg"                      alt="why is asmr relaxing"                ></p><p>Giulia Poerio’s Hubbub public engagement work has included her <a class="link"   href="https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/28427/Bookshelf%5FNBK453230.pdf?sequence=1#page=123" >psychological research <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on the autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR). The research stated that relaxing, tingling sensations begin at the top of the head and spread down the neck, spine, and sometimes throughout the rest of the body in response to specific triggers. According to this study, ASMR is fascinating, whether experienced or not. The sheer number of YouTube videos and accompanying viewership data show that it is far from a niche experience. According to anecdotal evidence, you can use ASMR as a sleep aid and a technique for increasing wellness.</p><p>People have even employed ASMR to assist them in curing their discomfort. While it requires further research to support this assertion, they conducted a study to keep it. In <a class="link"   href="https://asmruniversity.com/2015/04/04/peerj-peer-reviewed-research-asmr/" >2015, an analysis <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> indicated that 42 percent of individuals said ASMR helped them cope with chronic pain.</p><p>Scientists are still debating how ASMR can reduce chronic pain, although some relate it to the release of endorphins during an ASMR session. Endorphins are substances in the body that may make us happy and diminish our sense of pain. However, there is no authentication to support this idea.</p><p>Although they carried out a considerable study on ASMR and its impact on chronic pain, many individuals have found relief utilizing ASMR videos for their condition! If you suffer from chronic pain, try watching these ASMR videos for pleasure or to see if they help relieve your symptoms.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Is-ASMR-Good-For-You"><a href="#Part-3-Is-ASMR-Good-For-You" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Is ASMR Good For You?"></a>Part 3: Is ASMR Good For You?</h2><p>The study of ASMR is in its infancy at the moment. However, both anecdotal evidence and preliminary studies suggest that autonomic sensory meridian response, or ASMR, will have some positive effects, including the following:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/benefits-of-asmr-4.jpg"                      alt="is asmr good"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Immediate Relief:</strong> When someone experiences the chills and tingles associated with ASMR, we describe it as a delightful and calming sensation that occurs relatively quickly after exposure to the stimulus.</li><li><strong>The elevated state of mind</strong>: Early research found that after exposure to ASMR, eighty percent of Trusted Source participants experienced an improvement in their mood. People with greater levels of depression had a quicker drop in their benefits.</li><li><strong>Pain alleviation:</strong> The same research According to Reliable Source, some individuals who suffer from chronic pain had relief that lasted for up to three hours after being exposed to the substance.</li><li><strong>Greater intensity of focus</strong>: When you’re so engrossed in something that you lose track of time and concentrate so intently on it, you’re said to be in a “flow state.” Researchers have discovered that ASMR and the sort of focused attention you get when you’re in the zone, also known as flow, have been commonalities.</li><li><strong>Better sleep:</strong> ASMR has been found in preliminary studies to have the potential to assist in inducing a state of relaxation. Also, improve brainwave activity, which is necessary for a good night’s rest.</li><li><strong>Other advantages:</strong> People who participate in ASMR activities note improvements in areas such as decreased anxiety, fewer migraines, lower blood pressure, and other health benefits. Although they are consistent with what they tell us, these assertions still need to be supported by more studies.</li></ul><p>The best part is that almost anybody can use it. If you think these advantages may benefit you, you can try them. You can find out <strong>if ASMR is good for you</strong> without spending money or a doctor’s prescription online.</p><h2 id="Part-4-FAQ-People-Also-Ask"><a href="#Part-4-FAQ-People-Also-Ask" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: FAQ: People Also Ask"></a>Part 4: FAQ: People Also Ask</h2><h3 id="1-Does-ASMR-kill-brain-cells"><a href="#1-Does-ASMR-kill-brain-cells" class="headerlink" title="1. Does ASMR kill brain cells?"></a>1. Does ASMR kill brain cells?</h3><p>ASMR may promote relaxation and theta brainwaves needed for deep, restful sleep. Too many ASMR videos may desensitize viewers. Whispering, delicate touches, or even routine duties might cause it.</p><h3 id="2-What-are-ASMR-tingles"><a href="#2-What-are-ASMR-tingles" class="headerlink" title="2. What are ASMR tingles?"></a>2. What are ASMR tingles?</h3><p>ASMR tingles is a phrase used to describe a tingling, relaxing feeling that some individuals experience in reaction to certain auditory, visual, or tactile stimuli. The word “tingling” comes from the Greek word “tinge,” which means “to tingle.”</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>So, ASMR, “autonomous sensory meridian response,” defines the tingling sensation some individuals experience in reaction to particular stimuli. It has grown in popularity in the Internet community in recent years.</p><p>While research is still in its early stages, preliminary findings indicate that <strong>ASMR is good for your</strong> to focus, sleep, and general mood.

For example, HDR photography involves taking images in dark and bright areas. But because these images might not show much to the naked eyes, you’ll need an HDR program like <strong>EasyHDR</strong>. This software can recreate and design incredible HDR photos on Mac and Windows computers. So, this review post advises you whether <strong>Easy HDR</strong> is worth the money or not. We’ll also advise on the best way to edit and create HDR videos on PC.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Summary-Box-on-Easy-HDR"><a href="#Part-1-Summary-Box-on-Easy-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Summary Box on Easy HDR"></a>Part 1: Summary Box on Easy HDR</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Description</th><th>EasyHDR is an HDR photography software for highlighting image details in HDR photos.

Although there’s a free demo version, it’s pretty limited in features. Therefore, purchase the premium plan for $33 or $55 for personal and lifetime licenses.

Detailed Review for Easy HDR"></a>Part 2. Detailed Review for Easy HDR</h2><p>Before diving deeper into the detailed Easy HDR features, it’s important to note that the program has a demo version. You can use this version to practice and study the vital components of easyHDR. But be guided that the demo version exports images with a watermark. In addition, users can’t save HDRi in TIFF format. Let’s get in!</p><ol><li><strong>High-Quality Bracket Merging</strong></li></ol><p>A good quality HDRi software should easily merge different image exposures, making the photo look natural and spectacular. To start incorporating, drag the image brackets to easyHDR and press “Ok” on the pop-up screen. You can now try the different bracket merging effects until you find something that suits your preference.</p><ol><li><strong>Editing features</strong></li></ol><p>EasyHDR goes a step further to provide its users with a comprehensive list of editing features. For example, the “Clone Stamp” tool can remove unwanted objects like cables without blurring the photo. You can also use the “Tone Curve” feature to adjust the brightness of shadows and highlights.</p><ol><li><strong>Ghost removal</strong></li></ol><p>No, this is not the scary ghost that you know. Instead, these ghosting artefacts appear in misaligned photos due to moving objects like leaves, branches, cars, people, etc. With Easy HDR, you can eliminate the “ghosts” manually or automatically. Simply open the photo and turn on “Ghost Removal” to remove them automatically.</p><ol><li><strong>HDR batch processing</strong></li></ol><p>As expected, you can find it pretty tedious to import and merge each HDR bracket individually. For this reason, easyHDR comes with a “Batch Processing” feature that allows users to combine a whole folder of brackets automatically.</p><ol><li><strong>LDR enhancement</strong></li></ol><p>Although we’ve mainly focused on brackets and photos in this post, it’s important to note that easyHDR also works with single images. Instead of having three separate bracketed exposures, LDR (Low Dynamic Range) enhancement allows you to generate exposures from a single JPEG or RAW photo.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Tips-The-Best-Way-to-Edit-HDR-videos-on-your-Desktop"><a href="#Bonus-Tips-The-Best-Way-to-Edit-HDR-videos-on-your-Desktop" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tips: The Best Way to Edit HDR videos on your Desktop"></a>Bonus Tips: The Best Way to Edit HDR videos on your Desktop</h2><p>Like HDR images, HDR videos offer more comprehensive displays in dark and bright surroundings. In short, these videos allow more colourful and detailed highlight representations. Unfortunately, not all HDR editing programs can merge bracketed exposures effortlessly to produce outstanding results. And those that do can cost you an arm and a leg.</p><p>With that in mind, we recommend <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for professional and semi-professional HDR editors.

It’s no secret that podcasting is on the rise—more than 2.6 billion people in the world today consume audio content regularly.</p><p>As a result, more people are starting their podcasts, and many are making money. But how much does a podcaster make, and is it enough to live on? We’ll examine how different podcasters make and why there’s so much variation.</p><ol><li><a href="#part3-1">Sponsorship</a></li><li><a href="#part3-2">Complementary products</a></li><li><a href="#part3-3">Listeners’ donations</a></li><li><a href="#part3-4">Affiliate</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part4">Popular Podcasts Earnings in 2024</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Are-Podcasts-Profitable"><a href="#Part-1-Are-Podcasts-Profitable" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Are Podcasts Profitable?"></a>Part 1: Are Podcasts Profitable?</h2><p>Podcasts are among the most underutilized marketing tools around today. They can be an easy way to add value to your business and market your products and services.</p><p>As a bonus, podcasts aren’t expensive, and you can produce a high-quality episode in less than an hour. These days, podcasters are finding that their podcasts are very profitable. Some people say that podcasts are the only business where you can make a full-time living without owning real estate.</p><p>The secret? Make sure your podcast is something that people want to listen to. If people are listening, you can make money selling ads and subscriptions.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Much-Money-Do-Podcasters-Make"><a href="#Part-2-How-Much-Money-Do-Podcasters-Make" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Much Money Do Podcasters Make?"></a>Part 2: How Much Money Do Podcasters Make?</h2><p>Podcaster earnings vary widely. Most people who have made their first million by podcasting make no more than half a million dollars a year.</p><p>Consider a scenario to figure out what podcasters can expect to earn and how much they’ll need to invest in their studios and equipment. Let’s say you’re a podcaster and you have the following stats:</p><ul><li>5% of your audience buys a product through your link, earning you $20 for each.</li><li>Your 3% audience supports you on Patreon, leaving you with $7 per person per month.</li><li>1% of your audience purchases a monthly online course for $49.</li><li>You’re making about 5 podcasts per month.</li><li>And lastly, you’re placing 4 ads in every episode, spaced out throughout the episode.</li></ul><p>Considering all the statistics and more than 1,000 downloads&#x2F;listeners per episode, you could make more than $1000 per month, which is a good amount.</p><ul><li>$300&#x2F;month from affiliate sales</li><li>$210&#x2F;month from Patreon support</li><li>$490&#x2F;month from course sale</li><li><strong>Total &#x3D; $1000&#x2F;month</strong></li></ul><p>If you have 5000 download&#x2F;listeners per episode:</p><ul><li>$1500&#x2F;month from affiliate sales</li><li>$1050&#x2F;month from Patreon Support</li><li>$2450&#x2F;month from course sale</li><li><strong>Total &#x3D; $5000&#x2F;month</strong></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> These numbers are only speculative and assumptions. Depending on various factors, you could make anywhere from $1,000-$50,000 or more. That includes your reputation, strategy, and niche.</p><p>An example of this could include things like how much you want to charge to Patreon or possibly having a higher CPM sponsorship offer, or cost per thousand listeners based on expected performance and other factors.</p><h2 id="Part-3-All-Possible-Income-Sources-for-Podcasters"><a href="#Part-3-All-Possible-Income-Sources-for-Podcasters" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: All Possible Income Sources for Podcasters"></a>Part 3: All Possible Income Sources for Podcasters</h2><p>Many people would love to get paid to talk about their passions. That’s pretty much how it started for every podcaster. Yet, even though it may be easy to start a podcast, it’s not always so easy to make a living at it.</p><p>We’ll show you a bunch of ways podcasters earn a living doing something they love. Let’s take a look…</p><h3 id="Sponsorship"><a href="#Sponsorship" class="headerlink" title="Sponsorship"></a>Sponsorship</h3><p>In a podcast, a sponsor is the first thing you need to think about when seeking to make money from your podcast.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Exploring-Audio-Fading-Methods-Within-Audacity’s-Interface"><a href="#Exploring-Audio-Fading-Methods-Within-Audacity’s-Interface" class="headerlink" title="Exploring Audio Fading Methods Within Audacity’s Interface"></a>Exploring Audio Fading Methods Within Audacity’s Interface</h2><p>Free, open-source freeware for Windows and Mac, Audacity, is a powerful toolkit to Fade Audacity. You could wish to employ the common music production method of fading songs in and out of your podcast using Audacity fade. To make an engaging and deeper podcast, it’s helpful to understand how to slightly fade out the music so that it plays in the background but still makes it easy to hear the spoken track. There are a few ways to do this.</p><p>You can easily apply professional fades to your audio files with Audacity fade out effect. The audio in the chosen portion will progressively get quieter when the fade out effect is applied, ending in stillness. The fade out tool is nearly totally automated, making it simple and understandable for both novices and experts. Along with the other several tools under Audacity’s Effects menu, the fade out tool may be found there.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Linear-Fade-in-out"><a href="#Part-1-Linear-Fade-in-out" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Linear Fade in&#x2F;out"></a>Part 1. Linear Fade in&#x2F;out</h2><p>You may apply linear fades, a straightforward fade option, to any segment of your music. Alternatively, you might apply it to the full audio file. Linear fades come in two varieties. Fade-in and Fade-out are the two varieties. Any section of your audio that you apply a fade-in to will get muted and return to its original volume. Additionally, if you activate the fade-out feature in your audio, the audio will transition from its original volume to total quiet.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-Use-Linear-Fade-in-out"><a href="#Steps-to-Use-Linear-Fade-in-out" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Use Linear Fade in&#x2F;out:"></a><strong>Steps to Use Linear Fade in&#x2F;out:</strong></h3><p>To divide a track into several parts so you may apply a fade to a specific audio segment, press Cmd + I (or Ctrl + I).</p><p>In this example, we divided the clip at the eight-second mark and used the Time Shift tool to shift the second chunk to the new location.</p><p>By selecting the audio segment, you wish to fade out and selecting Effect &gt; Fade Out, you may add a fade-out to the initial clip.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/liner-fade-in-audacity.jpg"                      alt="liner fade in audacity"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Studio-Fade-Out"><a href="#Part-2-Studio-Fade-Out" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Studio Fade Out"></a>Part 2. Studio Fade Out</h2><p>This effect is shown by Audacity as a curve that resembles the letter S. It results in a very gentle fading. After the first boom, there is utter quiet. It’s a sound that actually gives off the impression of fading away over time. Using the repeat last effect, you can quickly repeat this fading option. Additionally, Ctrl + R serves as the shortcut for the same.</p><h3 id="How-to-Use-Studio-Fade-Out"><a href="#How-to-Use-Studio-Fade-Out" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Studio Fade Out:"></a><strong>How to Use Studio Fade Out:</strong></h3><p>Choose your audio segment, go to the Effect menu, slide to the bottom, and pick Studio Fade Out to apply the effect.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/studio-fade-out-audacity.jpg"                      alt="studio fade out audacity"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Adjustable-Fade"><a href="#Part-3-Adjustable-Fade" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Adjustable Fade"></a>Part 3. Adjustable Fade</h2><p>A dialog box will show up on the screen when you choose the customizable fade option. You may customize the form and pattern of the fading using that dialog box. You may use this ability to make partial fades if you’d like. You must maintain the tracks stacked one on top of the other with the lower track underneath the higher track and its end overlapping when employing this form of fade.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-Use-Adjustable-Fade"><a href="#Steps-to-Use-Adjustable-Fade" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Use Adjustable Fade:"></a><strong>Steps to Use Adjustable Fade:</strong></h3><ul><li>Select Effect from the menu.</li><li>Select the variable fading option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/adjustable-fade-audio-audacity.jpg"                      alt="adjustable fade audio audacity"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Crossfades-Audacity"><a href="#Part-4-Crossfades-Audacity" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Crossfades Audacity"></a>Part 4. Crossfades Audacity</h2><p>There are two choices available when using this effect. You have two options: either manually make a crossfade of your own, or utilize one of the pre-existing crossfades in Audacity. In Audacity, there are two crossfades that are accessible. Crossfade clips and Crossfade tracks are what they are. Crossfade clips make it easier to switch between two distinct clips. Additionally, crossfade tracks aid in crossfading between two audio tracks and are more exact.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-Use-Crossfades"><a href="#Steps-to-Use-Crossfades" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Use Crossfades:"></a><strong>Steps to Use Crossfades:</strong></h3><p>Using the Time Shift Tool, place your two clips adjacent to one another in order to apply a crossfade across them on the same track.</p><p>Select the area to be crossfaded using the Selection tool, and then click Effect &gt; Crossfade Clips to combine the sounds you’ve chosen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/crossafade-audio-with-audacity.jpg"                      alt="crossafade audio with audacity"                ></p><p>Use your Selection tool to organize the clips such that a crossfade will be applied between two clips on different tracks. Go to Effect &gt; Crossfade Songs, place the cursor where you want the fade to begin, then drag it across the tracks you wish to blend.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Alternative-Way-to-Fade-Audio"><a href="#Part-5-Alternative-Way-to-Fade-Audio" class="headerlink" title="Part 5. Alternative Way to Fade Audio"></a>Part 5. Alternative Way to Fade Audio</h2><p>Even though it’s still thought of as difficult, time-consuming work, audio editing is really pretty easy with the correct program or tool.

Color grading refers to a video editing technique that involves manipulating the hues of your original footage to achieve a specific look. You do this as part of your post-production process and require you to have specialist software.</p><p>Popular video editing software includes Adobe After Effects, Apple Final Cut Pro, and Filmora, with each offering you different degrees of usability and video editing tools. Nevertheless, color grading is an essential part of filmmaking and can be the secret sauce to you becoming an elite video maker.</p><h4 id="1-Your-camera-is-genre-less"><a href="#1-Your-camera-is-genre-less" class="headerlink" title="1. Your camera is genre-less"></a>1. Your camera is genre-less</h4><p>Your camera equipment only determines the quality of video you will produce. As such, you need to edit it further to present your message precisely. For example, your desert video can be the backdrop for a horror film or romantic comedy. However, your audience may struggle to make the distinction when viewing the video in its original form.</p><p>Therefore, applying techniques like color grading can help you lead them to the genre you want to depict. You will learn more about this as you read further down.</p><h4 id="2-Your-creative-identity"><a href="#2-Your-creative-identity" class="headerlink" title="2. Your creative identity"></a>2. Your creative identity</h4><p>The other reason for color grading is purely artistic. As a videographer, you would like audiences to instantly recognize your work, without them looking at the credits. Color grading can help you achieve this, provided you remain consistent in your editing.</p><p>For example, British filmmaker Christopher Nolan is famous for his use of film as compared to digital video, which allows him to portray color in its raw natural form. You can see this in the movie The Dark Night, where he emphasizes shadows by applying different shades of black and gray to his scenes.</p><p>With the justifications for the technique out of the way, here is how different types of color grading will affect your videos.</p><h4 id="•-It-can-help-you-set-a-timeline-for-your-video"><a href="#•-It-can-help-you-set-a-timeline-for-your-video" class="headerlink" title="• It can help you set a timeline for your video"></a>• It can help you set a timeline for your video</h4><p>Do you know that certain color schemes are specific to an era? Before you go down a rabbit hole of misinformation, here is a quick overview to get you up to speed.</p><p>Back in the day, most photos and videos were shot using film and incandescent lighting. As such, videos of that era had a similar color scheme due to the lack of variety in equipment. However, current technology makes it difficult to revert to those times with camera manufacturers focusing more on the technical aspects. For example, you now have smartphones that offer up to 50X zoom, which was unheard of in the 1930s.</p><p>So, how do you tell your audience that your video is from a bygone era? Unless you have access to a 70-year-old-camera, color grading is your only option. Typically, old westerns and classical films are synonymous with warm colors. Therefore, you can apply warm color grading or vintage color grading to achieve a similar look. For example, Hollywood directors brown wash their films to signify historical times.</p><h4 id="•-Color-grading-is-an-essential-tool-to-elicit-emotions"><a href="#•-Color-grading-is-an-essential-tool-to-elicit-emotions" class="headerlink" title="• Color grading is an essential tool to elicit emotions"></a>• Color grading is an essential tool to elicit emotions</h4><p>Which color is anger? According to psychologists, different colors can represent emotions. That is why most romantic comedies feature warm colors and more serious flicks emphasize cool colors.</p><p>For example, you can use teal and orange color grading to inspire a feeling of warmth and joy in your video. The colors are opposites, meaning they contrast impeccably and vary between emotions if you apply them correctly.</p><h4 id="•-Set-a-genre-with-color-grading"><a href="#•-Set-a-genre-with-color-grading" class="headerlink" title="• Set a genre with color grading"></a>• Set a genre with color grading</h4><p>You can also use color grading to inform audiences of the genre of your video. For example, horror films focus on red color grading to make you feel on edge and inspire fear. Your focus is more on the artistic effect, and you can achieve different levels of terror, depending on your edit.</p><p>Alternatively, color grading for documentaries focuses on color accuracy. As such, you will apply color grades that emphasize the natural colors of your subject matter. For example, if you are editing a travel vlog, using orange teal color grading can better highlight the skin tones of participants.</p><p>The above is a snippet of how color grading will affect your videos. However, you will get more insight into its effects in the next section.</p><h2 id="7-Types-of-Color-Grading-that-are-Worth-Trying"><a href="#7-Types-of-Color-Grading-that-are-Worth-Trying" class="headerlink" title="7 Types of Color Grading that are Worth Trying"></a>7 Types of Color Grading that are Worth Trying</h2><p>Simply put, color grading is the play on colors to achieve a specific finish. As such, here are seven types of color grading worth trying in your next video project.</p><h4 id="1-Analogous-Color-Grading"><a href="#1-Analogous-Color-Grading" class="headerlink" title="1. Analogous Color Grading"></a>1. Analogous Color Grading</h4><p>Analogous color grading involves applying colors next to each other on the color wheel. For example, you can apply warm color grading to your video by using different levels of red and orange. As a result, you create a sense of harmony in your video.</p><p>Analogous color grading is best for landscape and nature videos. Here is a sample of how to use this type of color grading.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/warm-color-grading-1.jpg"                      alt="different type of color grading - analogous color grading"                ></p><p>In this picture, director Ridley Scott applies orange teal color grading to highlight the sand and peaks. Additionally, the sky has lost its blue color, resulting in an alien planet feel.</p><h4 id="2-Moody-color-grading"><a href="#2-Moody-color-grading" class="headerlink" title="2. Moody color grading"></a>2. Moody color grading</h4><p>The technique involves employing cool colors to create a sense of mystery and intrigue. It works best for scenes with lots of shadows and dim lighting. As such, you only need to adjust the contrast to articulate the effect.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/warm-color-grading-2.jpg"                      alt="different type of color grading - moody color grading"                ></p><h4 id="3-Vintage-color-grading"><a href="#3-Vintage-color-grading" class="headerlink" title="3. Vintage color grading"></a>3. Vintage color grading</h4><p>Vintage color grading applies a retro look to your video, allowing you to depict a sense of nostalgia from your audience. Filmmakers use this type of color grading in flashback scenes or movies that represent a specific time in history. It involves toning down your contrast levels and highlighting the warm colors. Below is a sample of vintage color grading.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/warm-color-grading-3.jpg"                      alt="different type of color grading - vintage color grading"                ></p><h4 id="4-Bleach-Bypass"><a href="#4-Bleach-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="4. Bleach Bypass"></a>4. Bleach Bypass</h4><p>Bleach bypass color grading involves you emphasizing the color contrast in your video with little regard to each color’s saturation. As a result, your video projects a sense of chaos since the colors do not blend seamlessly.</p><p>You can observe the effect of bleach bypass color grading in the movie 300. The producer offers a stark contrast between colors, especially with red. Below is how bleach bypass color grading will affect your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/warm-color-grading-4.jpg"                      alt="different type of color grading - bleach bypass color grading"                ></p><h4 id="5-Cross-processing-color-grading"><a href="#5-Cross-processing-color-grading" class="headerlink" title="5. Cross processing color grading"></a>5. Cross processing color grading</h4><p>The technique involves applying opposite adjustments to colors in your video. The result is extreme color shifts leaving your video with an unconventional look.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/warm-color-grading-5.jpg"                      alt="different type of color grading - Cross processing color grading"                ></p><h4 id="6-High-Key-Saturated-color-grading"><a href="#6-High-Key-Saturated-color-grading" class="headerlink" title="6. High Key Saturated color grading"></a>6. High Key Saturated color grading</h4><p>In high key saturated color grading, you will make edits on the hue and saturation levels of your video’s color scheme. You may also have to adjust contrast levels to prevent one color from dominating the rest. As a result, your video features bright and color-rich scenes. Here is an example of the technique in use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/warm-color-grading-6.jpg"                      alt="different type of color grading - High Key Saturated color grading"                ></p><h4 id="7-Triadic-color-grading"><a href="#7-Triadic-color-grading" class="headerlink" title="7. Triadic color grading"></a>7. Triadic color grading</h4><p>Triadic color grading involves using evenly-spaced colors on the color wheel. You select a dominant color for your video and use the other two to complement it. Consequently, you focus your audience’s attention on a singular subject in your video. Although triadic color grading is losing popularity, you can apply it to your videos for a unique vintage look.</p><p>Examples of triadic color schemes include red-yellow-blue or purple-green-orange. Here is a sample of how to apply vintage color grading using triadic colors.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/warm-color-grading-7.jpg"                      alt="different type of color grading - Triadic color grading"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p><strong>●</strong> As you can see, there is a lot you can achieve when using color grading. You can influence emotions, set a theme or create your unique identity as a video artist. The above types of color grading cover each creative spectrum and provide you with a solid base to specialize your creativity.

For example, Hollywood directors brown wash their films to signify historical times.</p><h4 id="•-Color-grading-is-an-essential-tool-to-elicit-emotions-3"><a href="#•-Color-grading-is-an-essential-tool-to-elicit-emotions-3" class="headerlink" title="• Color grading is an essential tool to elicit emotions"></a>• Color grading is an essential tool to elicit emotions</h4><p>Which color is anger? According to psychologists, different colors can represent emotions. That is why most romantic comedies feature warm colors and more serious flicks emphasize cool colors.</p><p>For example, you can use teal and orange color grading to inspire a feeling of warmth and joy in your video. The colors are opposites, meaning they contrast impeccably and vary between emotions if you apply them correctly.</p><h4 id="•-Set-a-genre-with-color-grading-3"><a href="#•-Set-a-genre-with-color-grading-3" class="headerlink" title="• Set a genre with color grading"></a>• Set a genre with color grading</h4><p>You can also use color grading to inform audiences of the genre of your video. For example, horror films focus on red color grading to make you feel on edge and inspire fear. Your focus is more on the artistic effect, and you can achieve different levels of terror, depending on your edit.</p><p>Alternatively, color grading for documentaries focuses on color accuracy. As such, you will apply color grades that emphasize the natural colors of your subject matter. For example, if you are editing a travel vlog, using orange teal color grading can better highlight the skin tones of participants.</p><p>The above is a snippet of how color grading will affect your videos. However, you will get more insight into its effects in the next section.</p><h2 id="7-Types-of-Color-Grading-that-are-Worth-Trying-3"><a href="#7-Types-of-Color-Grading-that-are-Worth-Trying-3" class="headerlink" title="7 Types of Color Grading that are Worth Trying"></a>7 Types of Color Grading that are Worth Trying</h2><p>Simply put, color grading is the play on colors to achieve a specific finish. As such, here are seven types of color grading worth trying in your next video project.</p><h4 id="1-Analogous-Color-Grading-3"><a href="#1-Analogous-Color-Grading-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Analogous Color Grading"></a>1. Analogous Color Grading</h4><p>Analogous color grading involves applying colors next to each other on the color wheel. For example, you can apply warm color grading to your video by using different levels of red and orange. As a result, you create a sense of harmony in your video.</p><p>Analogous color grading is best for landscape and nature videos. Here is a sample of how to use this type of color grading.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/warm-color-grading-1.jpg"                      alt="different type of color grading - analogous color grading"                ></p><p>In this picture, director Ridley Scott applies orange teal color grading to highlight the sand and peaks. Additionally, the sky has lost its blue color, resulting in an alien planet feel.</p><h4 id="2-Moody-color-grading-3"><a href="#2-Moody-color-grading-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Moody color grading"></a>2. Moody color grading</h4><p>The technique involves employing cool colors to create a sense of mystery and intrigue. It works best for scenes with lots of shadows and dim lighting. As such, you only need to adjust the contrast to articulate the effect.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/warm-color-grading-2.jpg"                      alt="different type of color grading - moody color grading"                ></p><h4 id="3-Vintage-color-grading-3"><a href="#3-Vintage-color-grading-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Vintage color grading"></a>3. Vintage color grading</h4><p>Vintage color grading applies a retro look to your video, allowing you to depict a sense of nostalgia from your audience. Filmmakers use this type of color grading in flashback scenes or movies that represent a specific time in history. It involves toning down your contrast levels and highlighting the warm colors. Below is a sample of vintage color grading.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/warm-color-grading-3.jpg"                      alt="different type of color grading - vintage color grading"                ></p><h4 id="4-Bleach-Bypass-3"><a href="#4-Bleach-Bypass-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Bleach Bypass"></a>4. Bleach Bypass</h4><p>Bleach bypass color grading involves you emphasizing the color contrast in your video with little regard to each color’s saturation. As a result, your video projects a sense of chaos since the colors do not blend seamlessly.</p><p>You can observe the effect of bleach bypass color grading in the movie 300. The producer offers a stark contrast between colors, especially with red. Below is how bleach bypass color grading will affect your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/warm-color-grading-4.jpg"                      alt="different type of color grading - bleach bypass color grading"                ></p><h4 id="5-Cross-processing-color-grading-3"><a href="#5-Cross-processing-color-grading-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Cross processing color grading"></a>5. Cross processing color grading</h4><p>The technique involves applying opposite adjustments to colors in your video. The result is extreme color shifts leaving your video with an unconventional look.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/warm-color-grading-5.jpg"                      alt="different type of color grading - Cross processing color grading"                ></p><h4 id="6-High-Key-Saturated-color-grading-3"><a href="#6-High-Key-Saturated-color-grading-3" class="headerlink" title="6. High Key Saturated color grading"></a>6. High Key Saturated color grading</h4><p>In high key saturated color grading, you will make edits on the hue and saturation levels of your video’s color scheme. You may also have to adjust contrast levels to prevent one color from dominating the rest. As a result, your video features bright and color-rich scenes. Here is an example of the technique in use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/warm-color-grading-6.jpg"                      alt="different type of color grading - High Key Saturated color grading"                ></p><h4 id="7-Triadic-color-grading-3"><a href="#7-Triadic-color-grading-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Triadic color grading"></a>7. Triadic color grading</h4><p>Triadic color grading involves using evenly-spaced colors on the color wheel. You select a dominant color for your video and use the other two to complement it. Consequently, you focus your audience’s attention on a singular subject in your video. Although triadic color grading is losing popularity, you can apply it to your videos for a unique vintage look.</p><p>Examples of triadic color schemes include red-yellow-blue or purple-green-orange. Here is a sample of how to apply vintage color grading using triadic colors.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/warm-color-grading-7.jpg"                      alt="different type of color grading - Triadic color grading"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p><strong>●</strong> As you can see, there is a lot you can achieve when using color grading. You can influence emotions, set a theme or create your unique identity as a video artist. The above types of color grading cover each creative spectrum and provide you with a solid base to specialize your creativity.

Turn off the Notifications"></a>1. Turn off the Notifications</h3><p>With the increased number of notifications in Windows 11, you might get annoyed. For that, you can turn off the notifications from the ‘Settings.’ Either you can go to the settings from the Start Menu or by pressing ‘Win+I.’ Then, head over to ‘System’ and hit ‘Notifications.’ The notifications are ‘On’ by default, but you can turn them ‘Off’ if you want to.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/windows-11-secret-tips-and-tricks-1.jpg"                      alt="turn off unnecessary notifications"                ></p><h3 id="2-Minimize-Applications"><a href="#2-Minimize-Applications" class="headerlink" title="2.

It Opens the Team Chat app (Win + C), notification center (Win + N), Quick settings with (Win + A), and a lot more. Whereas the shortcuts for copying, pasting, and screenshots are the same as Windows 10.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/windows-11-secret-tips-and-tricks-3.jpg"                      alt="windows 11 shortcut keys"                ></p><h3 id="4-Taskbar-and-Start-Menu-Placements"><a href="#4-Taskbar-and-Start-Menu-Placements" class="headerlink" title="4. Taskbar and Start Menu Placements"></a>4. Taskbar and Start Menu Placements</h3><p>The biggest Windows 11 tip and trick is the placement of Taskbar and Start Menu. Windows 11 has a taskbar and start menu in the center. The relocation of the taskbar and the start menu can be done easily. By changing the placement, you can make Windows 11 look like Windows 10 if you prefer it that way. For that, open the ‘Taskbar Behavior’ and click on ‘Taskbar Alignment’ and relocate it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/windows-11-secret-tips-and-tricks-4.jpg"                      alt="align taskbar to the left"                ></p><h3 id="5-Remove-Unwanted-Ads-on-Apps"><a href="#5-Remove-Unwanted-Ads-on-Apps" class="headerlink" title="5. Remove Unwanted Ads on Apps"></a>5. Remove Unwanted Ads on Apps</h3><p>The updated technology allows you to have better control over the privacy of your data and device from personalized ads. For this, go to the ‘Settings’ panel and then move over to the ‘Privacy and Security’ section. From the right panel, hit the ‘General’ settings. Now you can select whether you want the apps or websites to show ads based on your interests.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/windows-11-secret-tips-and-tricks-5.jpg"                      alt="disable unwanted ads"                ></p><h3 id="6-Voice-Typing-Feature"><a href="#6-Voice-Typing-Feature" class="headerlink" title="6.

Widgets and Chat Customization"></a>7. Widgets and Chat Customization</h3><p>Using Widgets and Chats helps the user have a quick chat with people that they love the most. Widget and Chats are the two new features introduced in Windows 11.</p><p>However, some people do not like using this kind of stuff. They don’t even prefer crowding their taskbar. For such cases, you can turn them off from the toggle switches that are available in the ‘Show or Hide the buttons that appear on Taskbar’ or ‘Taskbar Items. ‘</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/windows-11-secret-tips-and-tricks-7.jpg"                      alt="disable widgets and other items"                ></p><h3 id="8-Block-Trackers-and-Pop-up"><a href="#8-Block-Trackers-and-Pop-up" class="headerlink" title="8.

Viewers can add comments on videos and they can also forward “hearts” to streamers as a token of appreciation for their impressive work. The app is actually very interaction with four major tabs:</p><p> 1. You will find two lists on <strong>first tab:</strong></p><p> First one is the Teleport option that takes broadcaster to any random place in world and reflects that place as your active broadcast location.</p><p> The second list contains information about all those broadcasts that you have viewed within last 24 hours.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-periscope-1.jpg"                      alt="use-periscope-1"                ></p><p> 2. <strong>The second tab</strong> on application is used to display list of public broadcasts on global level and users are free to join all of them. They are developed on the basis of your geographical location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-periscope-2.jpg"                      alt="use-periscope-2"                ></p><p> 3. <strong>The third tab</strong> again contains the information about list of live public broadcasts in list format.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-periscope-3.jpg"                      alt="use-periscope-3"                ></p><p> 4. <strong>The fourth tab</strong> is designed to assist users with easy search for followers. It also displays settings for your own profile and allows users to make basic adjustments for followers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-periscope-4.jpg"                      alt="use-periscope-4"                ></p><h2 id="How-to-watch-Periscope-Video"><a href="#How-to-watch-Periscope-Video" class="headerlink" title="How to watch Periscope Video?"></a>How to watch Periscope Video?</h2><p> If you want to enjoy a live broadcast on Periscope then you can either try the list format or go for the map version on global broadcast tab; simply touch over the ongoing event that seems interesting to you. It also allows real time interactions with the broadcasters as well as other users that are connected during a particular live event.</p><p><strong>The lists of features include:</strong></p><p> 1. You will find a say something field on your application at bottom portion; whenever you want to comment for any event, you can put your text in this field.</p><p> 2. On the right side, you will observe hearts and they keep on floating upward. Whenever you find something very interesting or just want to appreciate the efforts of broadcaster on channel then you can use these hearts as token for your words of appreciation. You need to tap on the screen to send this heart to broadcaster.</p><p> 3. There is a little person on bottom right corner of your app screen; it provides information about number of viewers on your broadcast. If you touch this tiny icon, it will take you to another page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-periscope-5.jpg"                      alt="use-periscope-5"                ></p><h2 id="How-to-Broadcast-on-Periscope"><a href="#How-to-Broadcast-on-Periscope" class="headerlink" title="How to Broadcast on Periscope?"></a>How to Broadcast on Periscope?</h2><p> As per the default setting, broadcasts stay public that means anyone can watch what you have uploaded. But in case if you want to prioritize your audience then Periscope application offers easy personalization. Use private broadcast feature to invite selected audience on your broadcasts. This broadcast setting icon is actually a small camera like shape that can be used from first as well as second tab easily.</p><p> During your very first visit to broadcast screen, you will find a permission required pop up. Here you have to hit on allow permissions option. Now enable all three options that appear on screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-periscope-6.jpg"                      alt="use-periscope-6"                ></p><p> Now you are at broadcast screen where you have to enter name or title of your broadcast event. Users can adjust their location preferences while converting broadcasts from private to public or vice versa view. Adjust the chat options and finally you will reach at your Twitter link. If you want to capture feeds from webcam then it can be switched easily by simply double tapping on device screen. Once all these controls have been adjusted then your app provides an event summery, you can approve it or edit before making your post live. It will also provide you details about how many hearts you have received from viewers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-periscope-7.jpg"                      alt="use-periscope-7"                ></p><p> Once your broadcast becomes live then it will stay online for next 24 hours and all viewers and followers will be able to replay, watch as well as share the information with other users.
