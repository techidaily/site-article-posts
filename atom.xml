If your phone charges with the cable, it means your cable is not a problem.</p><p>As mentioned above, you must ensure that you have enabled media and file transfers in the USB settings when you connect your phone to the computer. It is the only way that your computer has permission to access the files on your smartphone.</p><p>If you have an iPhone, ensure that your device is unlocked.

Well, they use creative assets known as vector art. Although the term may sound alien to you, it is common within creative circles, especially among professionals who use editing software in post-production.</p><p>The following is an overview of what vector art entails and why you should consider it for your next project. In addition, you will also find recommendations for the best free vector art and graphics websites to source for creative assets. Keep reading to discover more.</p><h2 id="Part1-How-to-Make-Good-Use-of-Vector-art"><a href="#Part1-How-to-Make-Good-Use-of-Vector-art" class="headerlink" title="Part1: How to Make Good Use of Vector art?"></a>Part1: How to Make Good Use of Vector art?</h2><p>So, what is vector art? Vector art is a creative term to describe images and illustrations you can easily modify without compromising their quality. For example, you can resize vector graphics to fit a billboard print without pixelating the original file. In addition, creating vector art involves using mathematical algorithms to create visual images on software such as Draw and Adobe Illustrator.</p><p>Furthermore, vector art results from using geometrical shapes to create images on a coordinate system. Typically, you represent each image point using a pair of numerical coordinates to indicate their distance from two fixed perpendicular lines. In addition, both fixed lines use a similar unit of length to determine the distance. As such, your origin point will always represent by coordinates 0,0.</p><p>The following are the common terms that vector art creators use in their work:</p><ul><li>Point</li></ul><p>The term refers to an exact location in the creative space. In addition, a point does not have length, width, or thickness dimensions. Instead, you represent it using numerical coordinates on a cartesian plane. For example, coordinates 0,0 represent the origin point on a 2D creative plane.</p><ul><li>Line</li></ul><p>A line is a segment of the creative space bound by two endpoints. In addition, you can represent it as a closed line segment where you indicate both endpoints or an open line segment that excludes the endpoints.</p><ul><li>Curves</li></ul><p>Conversely, curves are non-straight segments of your creative space. In addition, you use them to trace moving points in your creative space. For example, creators use parabolas to represent curves in their vector art.</p><ul><li>Polygons</li></ul><p>These images on your creative space have a specific number of connecting endpoints. For example, a triangle is a polygon with three connecting endpoints. In addition, you can create self-intersecting polygons where the image boundary crosses over itself. Star polygons are the most common example of self-intersecting polygons.</p><p>Vector art is best for creative works in the following categories:</p><ul><li>Album Covers.</li><li>Movie Posters.</li><li>Video Games.</li><li>Printed Ads.</li><li>Branded merchandise that features your logo.</li></ul><h2 id="Part2-Best-Free-vectors-websites-recommendations"><a href="#Part2-Best-Free-vectors-websites-recommendations" class="headerlink" title="Part2: Best Free vectors websites recommendations"></a>Part2: Best Free vectors websites recommendations</h2><p>Now that you know what vector art entails, here is a list of the best free vector websites you should check out.

As such, you should always consider vector files if you require larger images without sacrificing the quality.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/2024-approved-sjcam-sj7-star-action-camera-complete-review/"><u>2024 Approved  SJCam SJ7 Star Action Camera Complete Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unveiling-the-art-of-podcast-rss-mastery/"><u>2024 Approved  Unveiling the Art of Podcast RSS Mastery</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-strategies-for-muting-unwanted-sounds-in-multimedia/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved Strategies for Muting Unwanted Sounds in Multimedia</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-ideal-emulation-tools-to-relive-sonys-playstation-experience-for-2024/"><u>[New] Ideal Emulation Tools to Relive Sony's PlayStation Experience for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-revive-your-bricked-nokia-g310-in-minutes-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How To Revive Your Bricked Nokia G310 in Minutes | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://network-issues.techidaily.com/instant-relief-swiftly-uninstall-graphics-drivers-from-windows/"><u>Instant Relief: Swiftly Uninstall Graphics Drivers From Windows</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/periscope-review/"><u>Periscope Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/new-navigating-video-uploads-on-youtube-a-comprehensive-tutorial/"><u>[New] Navigating Video Uploads on YouTube  A Comprehensive Tutorial</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/how-to-disableremove-youtube-shorts-permanently2-for-2024/"><u>How to Disable/Remove YouTube Shorts Permanently?2 For 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-your-guide-to-stellar-igtv-talent/"><u>[New] Your Guide to Stellar IGTV Talent</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/new-gags-and-grins-techniques-in-parody-production/"><u>[New] Gags and Grins  Techniques in Parody Production</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-ai-editor.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-mac-green-screen-editing-a-review-of-the-top-software-choices/"><u>New 2024 Approved Mac Green Screen Editing A Review of the Top Software Choices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/complete-guide-for-recovering-contacts-files-on-htc-u23-pro-by-fonelab-android-recover-contacts/"><u>Complete guide for recovering contacts files on HTC U23 Pro.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-cutting-edge-speech-to-text-googles-pathway-for-precision/"><u>In 2024, Cutting-Edge Speech-to-Text  Google’s Pathway for Precision</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-text-messages-from-xiaomi-redmi-12-5g-to-new-phone-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Text Messages from Xiaomi Redmi 12 5G to New Phone | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/the-easiest-methods-to-hard-reset-nokia-g310-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>The Easiest Methods to Hard Reset Nokia G310 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-craft-and-modify-iphone-motion-videos-reducing-pace-effectively/"><u>[Updated] How to Craft & Modify iPhone Motion Videos  Reducing Pace Effectively</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

What Is an Podcast RSS Feed?"></a>Part 1. What Is an Podcast RSS Feed?</h2><p>RSS, Really Simple Syndication, has been around for quite a long time (since 1999), and it was introduced to allow internet users to stay connected with their favorite websites. In other words, it’s used to subscribe to news websites, emails, blogs, podcasts, etc. It is just a simple link looking like this:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/create-podcast-rss-feeds-1.jpg"                      alt="rss feed"                ></p><p>Your Podcast RSS feed makes the information about your podcast quickly accessible on various podcast directories, like Apple Podcast and Spotify. Yes, it holds the information about your podcast show and its episodes. So, whenever you create a new episode on the hosting website, it automatically updates it to podcast directories in real-time, thus making it accessible to listeners at their convenience.</p><p>Ultimately, an RSS feed saves you the stress of manually uploading new episodes of your podcast to various platforms! An RSS feed could also be referred to as;</p><ul><li>RSS channel</li><li>Newsfeed</li><li>RSS stream</li><li>Web feed</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-When-to-Use-an-RSS-Feed"><a href="#Part-2-When-to-Use-an-RSS-Feed" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. When to Use an RSS Feed"></a>Part 2. When to Use an RSS Feed</h2><p>The concept of an RSS feed is pretty simple. It is what bridges the gap between your content and internet users. It means it’s not only helpful to podcasters but also to websites, blogs, etc.</p><p>As we all know, the average internet user won’t always have the time to visit your website or podcast channel to check new posts. <strong>So, by using RSS Feed on your website, podcast channel, email, etc., it’ll be easy for them to stay updated with every new content you publish.</strong></p><p>RSS feed is necessary for any podcaster looking to thrive in the industry, and it’s the only way to allow your target audience to access your content quickly.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Do-I-Find-the-RSS-Feed-for-My-Podcast"><a href="#Part-3-How-Do-I-Find-the-RSS-Feed-for-My-Podcast" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How Do I Find the RSS Feed for My Podcast?"></a>Part 3. How Do I Find the RSS Feed for My Podcast?</h2><p>If you’ve uploaded podcasts to a hosting site and you’re wondering where to find the podcast RSS feed links, it’s pretty simple. You don’t need to do anything, as your RSS Feed will be automatically created once you set up your account on the platform.</p><p>Usually, the RSS feed can be found in Settings or the Directories tab. But, of course, that varies according to different hosting sites. So, we take buzzsprout as an example to show you how to get the RSS feed.</p><p>Step1 Open your podcast hosting website and navigate the Directories section. Then, locate any section tagged as Feed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/create-podcast-rss-feeds-2.jpg"                      alt="find rss feed from the directories tab"                ></p><p>Step2 Click on the Feed button. You should see the podcast RSS feed. You can easily copy it from there.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-To-Create-an-RSS-Feed-for-a-Podcast"><a href="#Part-4-How-To-Create-an-RSS-Feed-for-a-Podcast" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. How To Create an RSS Feed for a Podcast?"></a>Part 4. How To Create an RSS Feed for a Podcast?</h2><p>However, there is also a case that if you use a self-hosted website for podcasting, you’ll require a plugin to generate your podcast RSS feeds. You can’t use it as it’ll include other blog content instead of the podcast, although your website might have its own RSS feed,</p><p>Then it’s high time to create a podcast RSS feed. Nevertheless, the process depends on whether you’re using a hosting service or not. Read on to find out how to create an RSS feed with or without a hosting platform;</p><h3 id="Method-1-Create-an-RSS-feed-with-hosting-platforms"><a href="#Method-1-Create-an-RSS-feed-with-hosting-platforms" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Create an RSS feed with hosting platforms"></a>Method 1: Create an RSS feed with hosting platforms</h3><p>As mentioned, once you create an account with a podcast hosting website, your podcast RSS Feed will be automatically created. So you just need to complete your account setup, and once you publish a new podcast episode, you can find the RSS Feed in the relevant section of the podcast hosting platform.</p><p>We used the Castos hosting website to generate a podcast RSS Feed in the steps below;</p><p>Step1 Visit Castos website and set up an account with them.</p><p>Step2 Create a new podcast episode and fill in all necessary details in the relevant boxes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/create-podcast-rss-feeds-3.jpg"                      alt="create a new podcast episode"                ></p><p>Step3 Navigate to the Podcast Setting area and provide your podcast information, such as Title, Description, Cover art, etc. Afterward, click the relevant button to proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/create-podcast-rss-feeds-4.jpg"                      alt="navigate to the podcast setting area"                ></p><p>Step4 Once you successfully save your podcast details and upload the new episode, navigate to the Dashboard and locate your Podcast RSS Feed in the Distribution tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/create-podcast-rss-feeds-5.jpg"                      alt="rss feed castos"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Create-an-RSS-feed-without-a-hosting-platform"><a href="#Method-2-Create-an-RSS-feed-without-a-hosting-platform" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Create an RSS feed without a hosting platform"></a>Method 2: Create an RSS feed without a hosting platform</h3><p>Since the native RSS Feed of a self-hosted website usually contains blog article content, which is not needed in a podcast RSS Feed, you need a plugin like Powerpress to generate your podcast RSS feed.</p><p>The PowerPress plugin allows you to generate RSS feed containing only your podcast audio once you publish new content on your website. The following steps explain the process of creating an RSS feed without a hosting platform;</p><p>Step1 Open WordPress and log in to the backend of your WordPress website. Then, select Plugins from the left side and click Add New.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/create-podcast-rss-feeds-6.jpg"                      alt="open wordpress"                ></p><p>Step2 Search Powerpress plugin and click the Install button next to “PowerPress Podcasting Plugin by Bluburry.

Click on it and select Settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/create-podcast-rss-feeds-8.jpg"                      alt="select settings"                ></p><p>Step4 Click Feed, and you’ll see your RSS Feed link.

The RSS website can be accessed, and the process is pretty simple.

It means it’s not only helpful to podcasters but also to websites, blogs, etc.</p><p>As we all know, the average internet user won’t always have the time to visit your website or podcast channel to check new posts. <strong>So, by using RSS Feed on your website, podcast channel, email, etc., it’ll be easy for them to stay updated with every new content you publish.</strong></p><p>RSS feed is necessary for any podcaster looking to thrive in the industry, and it’s the only way to allow your target audience to access your content quickly.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Do-I-Find-the-RSS-Feed-for-My-Podcast-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-Do-I-Find-the-RSS-Feed-for-My-Podcast-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How Do I Find the RSS Feed for My Podcast?"></a>Part 3. How Do I Find the RSS Feed for My Podcast?</h2><p>If you’ve uploaded podcasts to a hosting site and you’re wondering where to find the podcast RSS feed links, it’s pretty simple. You don’t need to do anything, as your RSS Feed will be automatically created once you set up your account on the platform.</p><p>Usually, the RSS feed can be found in Settings or the Directories tab. But, of course, that varies according to different hosting sites. So, we take buzzsprout as an example to show you how to get the RSS feed.</p><p>Step1 Open your podcast hosting website and navigate the Directories section. Then, locate any section tagged as Feed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/create-podcast-rss-feeds-2.jpg"                      alt="find rss feed from the directories tab"                ></p><p>Step2 Click on the Feed button. You should see the podcast RSS feed. You can easily copy it from there.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-To-Create-an-RSS-Feed-for-a-Podcast-1"><a href="#Part-4-How-To-Create-an-RSS-Feed-for-a-Podcast-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. How To Create an RSS Feed for a Podcast?"></a>Part 4. How To Create an RSS Feed for a Podcast?</h2><p>However, there is also a case that if you use a self-hosted website for podcasting, you’ll require a plugin to generate your podcast RSS feeds. You can’t use it as it’ll include other blog content instead of the podcast, although your website might have its own RSS feed,</p><p>Then it’s high time to create a podcast RSS feed. Nevertheless, the process depends on whether you’re using a hosting service or not. Read on to find out how to create an RSS feed with or without a hosting platform;</p><h3 id="Method-1-Create-an-RSS-feed-with-hosting-platforms-1"><a href="#Method-1-Create-an-RSS-feed-with-hosting-platforms-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Create an RSS feed with hosting platforms"></a>Method 1: Create an RSS feed with hosting platforms</h3><p>As mentioned, once you create an account with a podcast hosting website, your podcast RSS Feed will be automatically created. So you just need to complete your account setup, and once you publish a new podcast episode, you can find the RSS Feed in the relevant section of the podcast hosting platform.</p><p>We used the Castos hosting website to generate a podcast RSS Feed in the steps below;</p><p>Step1 Visit Castos website and set up an account with them.</p><p>Step2 Create a new podcast episode and fill in all necessary details in the relevant boxes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/create-podcast-rss-feeds-3.jpg"                      alt="create a new podcast episode"                ></p><p>Step3 Navigate to the Podcast Setting area and provide your podcast information, such as Title, Description, Cover art, etc. Afterward, click the relevant button to proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/create-podcast-rss-feeds-4.jpg"                      alt="navigate to the podcast setting area"                ></p><p>Step4 Once you successfully save your podcast details and upload the new episode, navigate to the Dashboard and locate your Podcast RSS Feed in the Distribution tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/create-podcast-rss-feeds-5.jpg"                      alt="rss feed castos"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Create-an-RSS-feed-without-a-hosting-platform-1"><a href="#Method-2-Create-an-RSS-feed-without-a-hosting-platform-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Create an RSS feed without a hosting platform"></a>Method 2: Create an RSS feed without a hosting platform</h3><p>Since the native RSS Feed of a self-hosted website usually contains blog article content, which is not needed in a podcast RSS Feed, you need a plugin like Powerpress to generate your podcast RSS feed.</p><p>The PowerPress plugin allows you to generate RSS feed containing only your podcast audio once you publish new content on your website. The following steps explain the process of creating an RSS feed without a hosting platform;</p><p>Step1 Open WordPress and log in to the backend of your WordPress website. Then, select Plugins from the left side and click Add New.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/create-podcast-rss-feeds-6.jpg"                      alt="open wordpress"                ></p><p>Step2 Search Powerpress plugin and click the Install button next to “PowerPress Podcasting Plugin by Bluburry.

Click on it and select Settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/create-podcast-rss-feeds-8.jpg"                      alt="select settings"                ></p><p>Step4 Click Feed, and you’ll see your RSS Feed link.

SJCAM has designed SJ7 with an impressive combination of hardware and software that ensures appealing results for all clicks. This is a lightweight camera unit with a durable housing made up of aluminium alloy. You will definitely love its matte finish and those well-curved edges add more elegance to its first appearance. The combination of satin type plastic material on front and well finished aluminium body give it very pleasant looks with light, beautiful and strong construction. And the color options are quite impressive: rose gold, silver and the lovely matte black.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sjcam-sj7-star-ports-buttons.jpg"                      alt="SJ7 Star Design"                ></p><p> On the front portion of SJ7, you will find two LED indicators that keep on displaying its activity status, one settings button for making easy adjustments for shots via the panel, power button and the well-designed camera lens that ensures 166-degree field of view. On the backside, there is a 2-inch wide high-quality LCD touch screen panel. Using this LCD panel, you can easily play with all camera settings using figure tip movements, make easy adjustments for memory card storage selection, playback, camera settings and many more. Its bright screen displays complete information with proper readability; you will find details like remaining space in MicroSD storage, status of Wi-Fi, date&#x2F;time, current image quality setting, stabilization, battery status, frames per second, resolution and current shooting mode.</p><p> You can control video start and stop functions with the button located at top of this camera and here you will also find a speaker. On the right side of the device, there are three ports: Micro HDMI, Mini USB and MicroSD slot; you can connect an external microphone to SJ7 via this USB port. The battery compartment is located at the bottom side of this camera.</p><p> Users will definitely find it surprising to see that there is no threaded tripod hole, which is usually common in cameras. In this case, you will need a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >frame or waterproof case <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to adjust your camera on a tripod. As package does not include any classic thread inside, so you can take help from added frame to get your camera connected with any GoPro accessory. SJ7 can dive up to 30M with addition protective case and its built-in Wi-Fi with added remote app control makes controls much easier.</p><h2 id="In-the-Box"><a href="#In-the-Box" class="headerlink" title="In the Box"></a>In the Box</h2><p> Once you receive your SJ7 package, you will find so many accessories inside including:</p><ul><li>Waterproof case</li><li>Additional touchscreen cover</li><li>USB cable</li><li>J support</li><li>Handlebar attachment to adjust it on bicycle.</li><li>Helmet and stickers hooks</li><li>Frame that helps in mounting</li><li>Lens cleaning cloth</li><li>Tripod adapters</li><li>2 SJ cam adhesives</li><li>USB to mini USB cable</li><li>User manual in four different languages: German, Russian, Chinese and English.</li></ul><h2 id="Video-Quality"><a href="#Video-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Video Quality"></a>Video Quality</h2><p> The biggest deciding factor for selection of an action camera unit is its Video quality. SJ7 Star is capable enough to record shoots at native 4K resolution.</p><p> The color rendering option is pretty good with all natural effects so that users can make lossless adjustments for color correction during post processing. The wide color range allows this camera unit to set deep colours for every shot.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn more about how to correct color in your action camera video footage <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> It can deliver high definition videos with 1080p resolution settings whereas 4K has its own impression. Content appears with crisp details having well defined outlines. It is capable enough to manage changes between different color shades and ensures optimal white balance for all light exposures. On the other side, the audio quality is also satisfactory that makes your videos more stunning with impressive content delivery. The preferred recording format is Mov or .mp4 with  codec support.</p><p> The only thing that doesn’t provide satisfactory performance for videos in SJ7 is stabilizer, which did not support 4K mode. However, it can deliver good results in light vibration carrying shots, or for handheld modes but lowers down its performance when connected to mounts in a running field.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Stabilize Shaky Videos with Video Editor Software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Image-Quality"><a href="#Image-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Image Quality"></a>Image Quality</h2><p> When it comes to stills; you can make adjustments between 3M, 5M, 8.3M, 12M, 14M and 16M resolution to avail variable results as per requirements. Its 12MP sensor results all stills in JPEG format.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sj7-photo-sample.jpg"                      alt="SJ7 Star Image Sample"                ></p><p> The touch screen provides easy access to camera shooting modes; you simply need to wipe up and you can access all camera modes with ease:</p><p><strong>Photo Time Lapse:</strong> Allows impressive time lapse quality with numbers of individual shots.</p><p><strong>Video Time Lapse:</strong> When you want time lapse setting for videos.</p><p><strong>Record:</strong> Start capturing your videos.</p><p><strong>Photo Burst:</strong> Get maximum 10 photos in series.</p><p><strong>Self Timer:</strong> Can adjust time delay between shots.</p><p><strong>Capture:</strong> Click single photograph.</p><p> Once you switch to photo mode on SJ7 camera unit you will find great control for night shots and long exposure. The manual settings can lead you to easy selection of metering, EV exposure value correction and white balance.</p><p> All the photos are capture with sharp details and colors are well distributed on frames. The fine details make post production task much easier while ensuring appreciable overall quality at all settings.</p><h2 id="Image-Stabilization"><a href="#Image-Stabilization" class="headerlink" title="Image Stabilization"></a>Image Stabilization</h2><p> SJ7 is designed to offer rich content quality with its electronic image stabilization feature that handles all results smoothly during shaky shoots at high vibrations. The gyro sensor is combined with specially designed acceleration sensor so that all shakes and vibrations can be well stabilized at motion. Note that the image stabilization feature currently works only with 1080p resolution level and at 30fps and 60fps settings. It can deliver great results during handheld shoots but you will observe poor performance for extreme situations, especially when camera is mounted to capture a running field. But the fact is that this trouble is common in almost all action cameras that are designed using Ambarella Chipset.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top 7 Best Video Stabilizer Software for Shaky Footage <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Battery-and-Storage"><a href="#Battery-and-Storage" class="headerlink" title="Battery and Storage"></a>Battery and Storage</h2><p> SJ7 contains a 1000mAh battery inside that helps it to serve for longer time duration. Once you charge it fully, it can serve you up to 70 minutes when you are enjoying recording at 4K resolution level with 30 fps settings whereas service time gets reduced to 65 minutes when users switch to 60fps with 1080p. Note that, a dual charge safety feature is added to SJ7 battery with 2 special protection circuits so that overcharging damage can be avoided.</p><p> SJCAM SJ7 Star supports microSD cards up to 128 GB and Class 10 (U1) is recommended. If you often record in 4K resolution, then the U3 is recommended.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Storage Card for Action Camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Connectivity"><a href="#Connectivity" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity"></a>Connectivity</h2><p> SJCAM has designed this camera to provide easy remote control via dedicated application SJCAM Zone that works fine on Android and iOS devices. The built in Wi-Fi module assists in easy connectivity for remote device. On the hardware port side, you will find MicroHDMI port at one side of this camera, it generates HD video output. The Mini USB port assists in charging and can also be used to copy files from camera. It can also connect mic to your camera unit for improved voice control. The only missing thing is tripod threat as compared to its predecessor SJ6; this time you need to access frame to mount your device on the go.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> You will definitely love the 4K recording ability of SJ7 along with its touch display that makes settings adjustment much easier. The build quality is quite impressive with sturdy aluminium body. The image stabilizer works file on 1080p settings but you may find vibrations at 4K; well, here you need to make little compromise. If all these features are compared on price point then your investment on SJ7 will definitely be fruitful and you will be able to get fine clicks for all your adventurous trips in future.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >GoPro Hero5 Black Vs SJCAM SJ7 Star: Which one is better?

But Windows 10 has made the process a lot easier for people who have Windows computers. Importing photos and video in Windows 10 can be done through a few simple steps, which we will highlight below.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part1: Import Photos and Video from a Phone</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part2: Start Importing in Photos App</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"><strong>Part3: Troubleshooting the Phone to PC Connection</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part4"><strong>Part4: Import Photos and Video from a Camera</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Import-Photos-and-Video-from-a-Phone"><a href="#Part-1-Import-Photos-and-Video-from-a-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Import Photos and Video from a Phone"></a>Part 1: Import Photos and Video from a Phone</h2><h3 id="Step-1-Connecting-Your-Phone"><a href="#Step-1-Connecting-Your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Connecting Your Phone"></a>Step 1: Connecting Your Phone</h3><p>If you are moving photos and video to Windows 10 from a smartphone, you will first have to connect your phone to the computer. It can be done through the USB cable that you should have received with the smartphone. Plug one end of the cable into your phone and the other into the USB port of your desktop or laptop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/usb-cable.jpg"                      alt="Import Photos and Video in windows 10"                ></p><h3 id="Step-2-Enable-File-Exchange"><a href="#Step-2-Enable-File-Exchange" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Enable File Exchange"></a>Step 2: Enable File Exchange</h3><p>Your phone will have settings regarding file transfers when it is connected to a computer. Make sure that media viewing and transferring is selected, which will allow Windows 10 File Explorer on the computer to recognize your device.</p><h3 id="Step-3-Import-Photos-and-Videos"><a href="#Step-3-Import-Photos-and-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Import Photos and Videos"></a>Step 3: Import Photos and Videos</h3><p>Now that your phone is recognized, you should see the camera or phone pop up along with your hard drives and other external drives. You can right click on its icon, select “Import Photos and Videos” and proceed from there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-video-photos-to-windows-10.jpg"                      alt="Import Photos and Video in windows 10"                ></p><h3 id="Step-4-Import"><a href="#Step-4-Import" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Import"></a>Step 4: Import</h3><p>Your computer will tell you how many pictures and photos were found. You can either review, organize and group these items, or you can choose to import all the new items in one go.</p><p>The great thing about reviewing the photos and videos before importing them onto your computer is that you can choose folders for different files, name those folders and ensure that you are only importing files that are not on your system already.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Start-Importing-in-Photos-App"><a href="#Part-2-Start-Importing-in-Photos-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Start Importing in Photos App"></a>Part 2: Start Importing in Photos App</h2><p>Another option for you is the Photos app that is pre-installed in computers with Windows 10.</p><p>Go to Start -&gt; All Apps -&gt; Photos and open it up. Your phone or camera should be connected to the computer when you are attempting this process.</p><p>Click the Import button on the Photos app and choose the items that you want to import. When you have selected all the items you want, click on continue and then import. All your files will be added onto your computer and they will be visible within the Photos app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-photos-video-from-photos-app.jpg"                      alt="Import Photos and Video in windows 10"                ></p><p>Within the app, it is easy to see your photos and videos as they are organized based on the date they are imported. So you will be able to see exactly what you have added in the most recent imports and with future imports as well.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Add Titles&#x2F;Text to Video on Photos App in Windows 10 &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-3-Troubleshooting-the-Phone-to-PC-Connection"><a href="#Part-3-Troubleshooting-the-Phone-to-PC-Connection" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Troubleshooting the Phone to PC Connection"></a>Part 3: Troubleshooting the Phone to PC Connection</h2><p>There are instances where you may have some problems connecting your phone to the computer, even if you have the USB cable connected on both ends.</p><p>The first thing to check is whether your USB port works. Try connecting some other device, such as a mouse or keyboard, into that port. If the device works, it means your port is not the cause of the problem. Now check the cable with a smartphone charger. If your phone charges with the cable, it means your cable is not a problem.</p><p>As mentioned above, you must ensure that you have enabled media and file transfers in the USB settings when you connect your phone to the computer. It is the only way that your computer has permission to access the files on your smartphone.</p><p>If you have an iPhone, ensure that your device is unlocked. You will get a “Trust this device” prompt and you must accept it. And if your photos are saved directly to iCloud and not your iPhone, you will need to complete a transfer from iCloud, which you can do by visiting the website or using the relevant desktop app.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Import-Photos-and-Video-from-a-Camera"><a href="#Part-4-Import-Photos-and-Video-from-a-Camera" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Import Photos and Video from a Camera"></a>Part 4: Import Photos and Video from a Camera</h2><p>Those who are importing photos and videos from a camera rather than a smartphone can use the above options as well.

There are loads of romantic songs out there, so picking the right one for your marry me song can be hard. Let us help to inspire you with our pick of the 10 best proposal songs out there, tried and tested by lovers all over the world.</p><h4 id="1-Perfect-Ed-Sheeran"><a href="#1-Perfect-Ed-Sheeran" class="headerlink" title="1. Perfect - Ed Sheeran"></a>1. Perfect - Ed Sheeran</h4><p>Dear Mr. Sheeran has graced us with bucket loads of potential marriage proposal songs, but if we had to pick one, it would definitely be ‘Perfect’. From the lilting melodies to the meaning behind the words, it’s just beautiful from start to finish and perfect for setting the mood.</p><h4 id="2-Marry-you-Bruno-Mars"><a href="#2-Marry-you-Bruno-Mars" class="headerlink" title="2. Marry you - Bruno Mars"></a>2. Marry you - Bruno Mars</h4><p>It’s a bit more upbeat than many of the best proposal songs, but does that mean it’s not awesome? No. Marry you is a happy, fun and simple soundtrack to a proposal, without being too mushy or overly sappy.</p><h4 id="3-Make-you-feel-my-love-Adele"><a href="#3-Make-you-feel-my-love-Adele" class="headerlink" title="3. Make you feel my love - Adele"></a>3. Make you feel my love - Adele</h4><p>Simply one of the best songs of all time, let alone the best proposal songs, the haunting lyrics of Adele coupled with the ultra-romantic lyrics are sure to set any heart aflutter. The original purveyor of romantic songs, Bob Dylan, actually wrote the words, but we prefer Adele’s dulcet vocals for your perfect marry me song.</p><h4 id="4-All-of-me-John-Legend"><a href="#4-All-of-me-John-Legend" class="headerlink" title="4. All of me - John Legend"></a>4. All of me - John Legend</h4><p>If you’ve ever experienced the feeling of dizzying, overwhelming euphoria when you’re with your lover, you’ll feel an absolute affinity with the lyrics of this song. All your curves and all your edges, all your perfect imperfections… one of the most romantic love songs ever.</p><h4 id="5-Better-together-Jack-Johnson"><a href="#5-Better-together-Jack-Johnson" class="headerlink" title="5. Better together - Jack Johnson"></a>5. Better together - Jack Johnson</h4><p>Jack Johnson just oozes romance. His voice is like a bar of chocolate smothered in Champagne and topped with fillet steak. And when you add that to the words of this, one of the best proposal songs in history, we think you’ve got something really special.</p><h4 id="6-Truly-madly-deeply-Savage-Garden"><a href="#6-Truly-madly-deeply-Savage-Garden" class="headerlink" title="6. Truly madly deeply - Savage Garden"></a>6. Truly madly deeply - Savage Garden</h4><p>Do you want to stand with your loved one on a mountain? Do you want to bathe with them in the sea? This song really says it all and is a perfect choice of marriage proposal songs for you and your loved one to get all squishy to.</p><h4 id="7-Let’s-stay-together-Al-Green"><a href="#7-Let’s-stay-together-Al-Green" class="headerlink" title="7. Let’s stay together - Al Green"></a>7. Let’s stay together - Al Green</h4><p>Some things never need to be changed, and this 1972 Motown classic is still as relevant today as it was 40 years ago. A bit more upbeat, which is good if you’re not so into gushing romantic songs, but still very meaningful and lovely to propose to.</p><h4 id="8-I-swear-All-4-One"><a href="#8-I-swear-All-4-One" class="headerlink" title="8. I swear - All-4-One"></a>8. I swear - All-4-One</h4><p>American R&amp;B and pop group, All-4-One, are definitely best known for their hit single ‘I swear’. It’s a perfect encapsulation of love and adoration, describing so many happy relationships in perfect vocal harmony. An ideal marry me song if ever we heard one!</p><h4 id="9-I-love-you-always-forever-Donna-Lewis"><a href="#9-I-love-you-always-forever-Donna-Lewis" class="headerlink" title="9. I love you always forever - Donna Lewis"></a>9. I love you always forever - Donna Lewis</h4><p>This is one of those songs you can both enjoy a bop or a slow dance to, perfectly merging the best of romantic love songs with upbeat pop fun. It’s a good one to blend into the background rather than taking over the moment, and yet the lyrics say it all.</p><h4 id="10-Every-little-thing-she-does-is-magic-the-Police"><a href="#10-Every-little-thing-she-does-is-magic-the-Police" class="headerlink" title="10. Every little thing she does is magic - the Police"></a>10. Every little thing she does is magic - the Police</h4><p>A true classic by the master of lyrics, this Police hit is an alternative choice of marriage proposal songs, simply highlighting how truly awesome your loved one really is. It’s one you could have a little jiggle to, then surprise her with a drop to one knee at the slow part.</p><p>When it comes to marriage proposal songs, your own experience and time together has to play a big part. If there’s a song that means a lot to both of you, maybe to do with how you met or something that happened together, but it’s not on the list, then absolutely it should be a contender for your marry me song. However, if you’re stuck for ideas, we hope our list has inspired you to find your best proposal songs to share with your beloved.</p><h2 id="Don’t-forget-to-record-this-important-moment"><a href="#Don’t-forget-to-record-this-important-moment" class="headerlink" title="Don’t forget to record this important moment"></a>Don’t forget to record this important moment</h2><p>This will (hopefully) be one of the best moments in both of your lives, a significant second which will change your futures forever. Instead of letting the memory fade away, why not capture the moment to treasure forever. Simply set up your smartphone or action camera before popping the question, and you could have your very own romantic proposal video complete with your marry me song to look back on later with love.</p><p>If you’re keen to turn your footage into a more professional, watchable mini movie, you can undertake all the editing you need using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Final Cut Pro is a paid software and you have to pay a hefty one-time fee for lifetime full access. Therefore, it is important that you know everything about Final Cut Pro before purchasing it.</p><p>We have done a complete review of Apple Final Cut Pro.

History of Final Cut Pro"></a>1. History of Final Cut Pro</h2><p>The journey of Final Cut Pro(FCP) began as an alternative to Adobe Premiere Pro. FCP was initially developed by Macromedia. The designer of FCP named Randy Ubillos used to work for Adobe Premiere previously. In 1998, Apple purchased the development team of Final Cut Pro. Hence, Macromedia FCP turned into Apple FCP.</p><p>The popularity of Final Cut Pro started to pick up in the early 2000s. A popular movie producer named Michael Bloom praised FCP to boost its popularity. The software did not crash even once during rendering a movie. Soon, the popular director Roger Avery became the spokesperson for Apple FCP. This encouraged video creators and producers to try out Final Cut Pro as a video editor.</p><p>The breakthrough came in 2002 when Final Cut Pro was awarded a Primetime Emmy Engineering Award. Final Cut Express was launched in 2003 at an affordable rate. But it was discontinued in 2011. This is because Apple launched Final Cut Pro X in April 2011.</p><p>Final Cut Pro X came with a new user interface and workflow. It was packed with loads of new features. Subsequently, new features such as effects, filters, color enhancement, and support for HDR and 360-degree video were introduced. This helped it to become one of the best video editors in the world.</p><h2 id="2-Features-of-Final-Cut-Pro"><a href="#2-Features-of-Final-Cut-Pro" class="headerlink" title="2.

There is no doubt that a great text effect and a stunning text animation take video to the next level. Final Cut Pro has loads of text effects and presets that you can apply to enhance titles and captions. Starting from opening and ending crediting to lower-thirds and subtitles, there are presets for everything.</p><p><strong>Transitions</strong>: Transitions are an integral part of video editing. Whenever there is a change of scenes, there has to be a transition effect. A transition prevents jump cuts and awkward scene shifting. Final Cut Pro has a wide range of transitions that will enhance your video content.</p><p><strong>Video Effects</strong>: There are over 300 video effects in Final Cut Pro. The more the video effects, the more popular the video editor becomes. But there is no point in having loads of video effects unless they can impactful.

Final Cut Pro supports the Chroma key by which you can remove the green screen background. You can replace it with anything starting from static background to dynamic background. Besides, you can add effects and animations to make it dramatic and cinematic.</p><p><strong>Audio Editing</strong>: Last but not least, the audio part of a video is extremely important.

How to Edit Video with Final Cut Pro</p><p>Now that we have reviewed Final Cut Pro thoroughly, it is time to illustrate how to use Final Cut Pro.

Researching all the numerous possibilities and choosing the appropriate service for you can be a mammoth process, leaving many people merely choosing one of the major brands, like Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive. The regular SSD or hard drive can no longer suffice with the quantity of data that needs to be stored, so the only option is to subscribe to a possible cloud storage service. The best way to store data in the cloud is through cloud storage, accessed from any location and device.</p><p>We’ve evaluated all the various cloud storage out there and put up this cloud storage comparison to make the task simpler. If you want to save money on storage, <strong>cloud storage pricing</strong> is essential when choosing the best cloud storage service provider.</p><p>So, read on as we discuss <strong>cloud storage prices</strong> below:</p><h2 id="Part-1-Cloud-Storage-Pricing-Comparison"><a href="#Part-1-Cloud-Storage-Pricing-Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Cloud Storage Pricing Comparison"></a>Part 1: Cloud Storage Pricing Comparison</h2><p>Here is a table comparing top cloud storage providers’ free storage space and their <strong>cloud storage pricing comparison</strong>.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Cloud Storage Providers</th><th>Free Storage</th><th>Monthly Price</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Apple iCloud</td><td>5GB</td><td>50GB - $1200GB - $32TB - $10</td></tr><tr><td>Google Drive</td><td>15GB</td><td>100GB - $7.49250GB - $10500GB - $18.95</td></tr><tr><td>Amazon</td><td>5GB</td><td>100GB - $21TB - $7 2TB - $12</td></tr><tr><td>Microsoft</td><td>5GB</td><td>100GB of storage for $2 per month or $20 annually</td></tr><tr><td>Dropbox</td><td>2GB</td><td>Plus: 2TB - $10Family: 2TB - $17.</td></tr><tr><td>pCloud</td><td>10GB</td><td>500GB - $50 a year2TB - $100 a year10TB - Custom</td></tr><tr><td>Sync.com</td><td>5GB</td><td>1TB - $6Unlimited - $15</td></tr><tr><td>Icedrive</td><td>10GB</td><td>150GB - $1.671TB - $4.175TB - $15</td></tr></tbody></table><p>However, Google Drive and Photos are already fine if you don’t wish to invest much money. For example, you can use Google Photos to store photos in the cloud.</p><p>The security and privacy of cloud services are crucial, correct storage capacity and device compatibility.</p><p>If security is your top priority, choose Sync.com, IceDrive, and pCloud. They are the most robust encryption and authentication system for cloud storage.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-Price-Recommendations"><a href="#Part-2-Best-Price-Recommendations" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Best Price Recommendations"></a>Part 2: Best Price Recommendations</h2><p>Here we recommend the cloud storage services with the best prices in three categories.</p><h3 id="1-Best-price-of-lifetime-license-cloud-storage"><a href="#1-Best-price-of-lifetime-license-cloud-storage" class="headerlink" title="1.

Overall cheapest cloud storage service"></a>3. Overall cheapest cloud storage service</h3><p>You can use the following cloud service providers for the cheapest cloud storage pricing.</p><p><em><strong># Sync.com</strong></em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/cloud-storage-pricing-5.JPG"                      alt="sync.com"                ></p><p>Sync.com comes out on top of our list of the best cloud storage options because the company emphasizes data protection while maintaining a high functionality level for more skilled users. The fact that it is encrypted from end to end implies that both its upload and download rates are rather sluggish. Because this is a zero-knowledge service, nobody but you will be able to decrypt your data. Even though there are no monthly plans available, the price of the service is relatively reasonable, which is a plus given the high level of protection it provides; yet, this absence may be inconvenient for specific customers.</p><p><strong>Pricing:</strong> 5GB for free, 1TB - $6; and Unlimited - $15</p><p><em><strong># IceDrive</strong></em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/cloud-storage-pricing-6.JPG"                      alt="icedrive"                ></p><p>IceDrive, a cloud storage newcomer in the United Kingdom, may not yet have the power and polish of the leading competitors. Still, the firm already has more than enough cool features to take a cautious look. Users of Windows may navigate their storage space using Explorer, for instance, and do tasks such as relocating, renaming, opening, and editing files, just as if they were working on a local disk. A specialized application compatible with Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux takes things further by enabling you to explore your file system, preview documents, and stream your media files using an integrated player.</p><p><strong>Pricing:</strong> 10GB for free, 150GB - $1.67; 1TB - $4.17; and 5TB - $15</p><p><em><strong># Google Drive</strong></em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/cloud-storage-pricing-7.JPG"                      alt="googledrive"                ></p><p>There are six different membership levels available for Google One, the most basic of which provides 100GB of storage space for $2 per month. Using the Google One app, you can easily manage your account, switch between plans, free up storage space on your account, and take advantage of other exclusive member perks. If you go to the Google Drive website, you will discover that most of their plans are geared toward businesses and cost between $6 and $18 per month per user. Every business plan comes with a free trial period of fourteen days.</p><p><strong>Pricing</strong>: 15GB for free, 100GB - $7.49; 250GB - $10; and 500GB - $18.95 monthly</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-to-consider-other-than-price-when-choosing-cloud-storage-services"><a href="#Part-3-What-to-consider-other-than-price-when-choosing-cloud-storage-services" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What to consider other than price when choosing cloud storage services?"></a>Part 3: What to consider other than price when choosing cloud storage services?</h2><p><strong>Cloud storage pricing</strong> is a vital factor when choosing a service. However, the requirements and evaluation standards you employ when selecting a cloud provider will be particular to your business. So, any service provider evaluation will often concentrate on a few critical criteria.</p><p><strong>1. Authorities and Standards</strong></p><p>The adherence to industry best practices and standards is demonstrated by providers who follow recognized standards and quality frameworks. Measures can be pretty valuable for narrowing down the pool of potential suppliers, even though they might not ultimately influence which service provider you select.</p><p><strong>2. Locking of Cloud Data</strong></p><p>It is reasonable to worry about becoming bound to a specific cloud vendor. As <strong>cloud storage prices</strong> become increasingly popular and affordable, more applications support the most widely used cloud services. Thus, seeking applications adopting a multi-cloud data strategy is advisable to guarantee that freedom. There are now multi-cloud data management tools that enable clients to select between avoiding cloud vendor lock-in and application separation from specific cloud storage providers.</p><p><strong>3. Access Cost and Speed</strong></p><p>Organizations must consider two key aspects of data access to cloud services: speed and affordability. Understanding cloud storage providers’ service-level agreements (SLAs) is essential for speed. Generally speaking, the storage business can loosen its guarantees regarding access speed the more affordable the storage is. This is especially true for cloud archive storage, which costs very little, where the SLA for data access is expressed in hours.</p><h2 id="Part-4-FAQs"><a href="#Part-4-FAQs" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: FAQs"></a>Part 4: FAQs</h2><h3 id="1-How-can-I-get-100GB-for-free"><a href="#1-How-can-I-get-100GB-for-free" class="headerlink" title="1. How can I get 100GB for free?"></a>1. How can I get 100GB for free?</h3><p>Most cloud storage companies give customers free storage, such as 2GB, 5GB, or 15GB. Very few cloud storage services offer 100GB of free internet storage. As far as I’m aware, Degoo and CBackup are the storage companies that offer 100GB of free cloud storage, followed by Mega’s 50GB of free storage.</p><h3 id="2-Where-can-I-get-1TB-of-cloud-storage-for-free"><a href="#2-Where-can-I-get-1TB-of-cloud-storage-for-free" class="headerlink" title="2.

TeraBox also guarantees ISO&#x2F;IEC-certified cloud security and offers “Locked Box” functionality for private cloud storage.</p><h3 id="3-Which-cloud-storage-is-the-cheapest"><a href="#3-Which-cloud-storage-is-the-cheapest" class="headerlink" title="3. Which cloud storage is the cheapest?"></a>3. Which cloud storage is the cheapest?</h3><p>The least expensive 1TB of cloud storage is available from Icedrive for $4.17 per month when invoiced annually. Nevertheless, Sync.com 2TB plan, which costs $8 per month, provides a superior bargain. IDrive is the lowest option regarding online backup, offering 5TB for just $59.62 for the first year.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>After comparing our best choices of <strong>GCP storage pricing</strong> for data storage, we hope you have all the details you require to make an informed decision.

Overall cheapest cloud storage service</h3><p>You can use the following cloud service providers for the cheapest cloud storage pricing.</p><p><em><strong># Sync.com</strong></em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/cloud-storage-pricing-5.JPG"                      alt="sync.com"                ></p><p>Sync.com comes out on top of our list of the best cloud storage options because the company emphasizes data protection while maintaining a high functionality level for more skilled users. The fact that it is encrypted from end to end implies that both its upload and download rates are rather sluggish. Because this is a zero-knowledge service, nobody but you will be able to decrypt your data. Even though there are no monthly plans available, the price of the service is relatively reasonable, which is a plus given the high level of protection it provides; yet, this absence may be inconvenient for specific customers.</p><p><strong>Pricing:</strong> 5GB for free, 1TB - $6; and Unlimited - $15</p><p><em><strong># IceDrive</strong></em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/cloud-storage-pricing-6.JPG"                      alt="icedrive"                ></p><p>IceDrive, a cloud storage newcomer in the United Kingdom, may not yet have the power and polish of the leading competitors. Still, the firm already has more than enough cool features to take a cautious look. Users of Windows may navigate their storage space using Explorer, for instance, and do tasks such as relocating, renaming, opening, and editing files, just as if they were working on a local disk. A specialized application compatible with Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux takes things further by enabling you to explore your file system, preview documents, and stream your media files using an integrated player.</p><p><strong>Pricing:</strong> 10GB for free, 150GB - $1.67; 1TB - $4.17; and 5TB - $15</p><p><em><strong># Google Drive</strong></em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/cloud-storage-pricing-7.JPG"                      alt="googledrive"                ></p><p>There are six different membership levels available for Google One, the most basic of which provides 100GB of storage space for $2 per month. Using the Google One app, you can easily manage your account, switch between plans, free up storage space on your account, and take advantage of other exclusive member perks. If you go to the Google Drive website, you will discover that most of their plans are geared toward businesses and cost between $6 and $18 per month per user. Every business plan comes with a free trial period of fourteen days.</p><p><strong>Pricing</strong>: 15GB for free, 100GB - $7.49; 250GB - $10; and 500GB - $18.95 monthly</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-to-consider-other-than-price-when-choosing-cloud-storage-services-1"><a href="#Part-3-What-to-consider-other-than-price-when-choosing-cloud-storage-services-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What to consider other than price when choosing cloud storage services?"></a>Part 3: What to consider other than price when choosing cloud storage services?</h2><p><strong>Cloud storage pricing</strong> is a vital factor when choosing a service. However, the requirements and evaluation standards you employ when selecting a cloud provider will be particular to your business. So, any service provider evaluation will often concentrate on a few critical criteria.</p><p><strong>1. Authorities and Standards</strong></p><p>The adherence to industry best practices and standards is demonstrated by providers who follow recognized standards and quality frameworks. Measures can be pretty valuable for narrowing down the pool of potential suppliers, even though they might not ultimately influence which service provider you select.</p><p><strong>2. Locking of Cloud Data</strong></p><p>It is reasonable to worry about becoming bound to a specific cloud vendor. As <strong>cloud storage prices</strong> become increasingly popular and affordable, more applications support the most widely used cloud services. Thus, seeking applications adopting a multi-cloud data strategy is advisable to guarantee that freedom. There are now multi-cloud data management tools that enable clients to select between avoiding cloud vendor lock-in and application separation from specific cloud storage providers.</p><p><strong>3. Access Cost and Speed</strong></p><p>Organizations must consider two key aspects of data access to cloud services: speed and affordability. Understanding cloud storage providers’ service-level agreements (SLAs) is essential for speed. Generally speaking, the storage business can loosen its guarantees regarding access speed the more affordable the storage is. This is especially true for cloud archive storage, which costs very little, where the SLA for data access is expressed in hours.</p><h2 id="Part-4-FAQs-1"><a href="#Part-4-FAQs-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: FAQs"></a>Part 4: FAQs</h2><h3 id="1-How-can-I-get-100GB-for-free-1"><a href="#1-How-can-I-get-100GB-for-free-1" class="headerlink" title="1. How can I get 100GB for free?"></a>1. How can I get 100GB for free?</h3><p>Most cloud storage companies give customers free storage, such as 2GB, 5GB, or 15GB. Very few cloud storage services offer 100GB of free internet storage. As far as I’m aware, Degoo and CBackup are the storage companies that offer 100GB of free cloud storage, followed by Mega’s 50GB of free storage.</p><h3 id="2-Where-can-I-get-1TB-of-cloud-storage-for-free-1"><a href="#2-Where-can-I-get-1TB-of-cloud-storage-for-free-1" class="headerlink" title="2.

Nevertheless, Sync.com 2TB plan, which costs $8 per month, provides a superior bargain. IDrive is the lowest option regarding online backup, offering 5TB for just $59.62 for the first year.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>After comparing our best choices of <strong>GCP storage pricing</strong> for data storage, we hope you have all the details you require to make an informed decision.

Most of the professionals advise to invest on good quality camera lenses because they offer longer lifespan. You will be glad to know that lenses that have been designed years ago can be easily mounted on latest camera units and they still ensure outstanding results.</p><p> Those who are planning to buy new camera lenses may be little confused while making understanding for the basic specifications and features. If so, then the article below can be helpful for you as it contains details about best lenses for 4k cameras.</p><h2 id="How-to-choose-the-right-lens-for-your-4k-Camera"><a href="#How-to-choose-the-right-lens-for-your-4k-Camera" class="headerlink" title="How to choose the right lens for your 4k Camera?"></a>How to choose the right lens for your 4k Camera?</h2><h4 id="1-Lens-Mount"><a href="#1-Lens-Mount" class="headerlink" title="1.Lens Mount"></a>1.Lens Mount</h4><p> One of the most essential accessories for your camera lenses are mounts. All designers offer different mount systems for attaching lenses to the cameras so you can easily find a wide range of mount systems that are dedicated for DSLRs or to the mirror less systems like Micro Four Thirds, Sony E Mount, Nikon F and Canon EF. Few latest lenses also offer advanced features like making electrical contacts so that lens information gets automatically transferred to camera circuitry. It can also have a square type groove in the middle portion that works like a holder for filters.</p><h4 id="2-Sensor-Size"><a href="#2-Sensor-Size" class="headerlink" title="2. Sensor Size"></a>2. Sensor Size</h4><p> One more essential factor that demands your attention at the time of lens purchase is the camera sensor format. You can find a wide range of sensors in market ranging between Micro Four Thirds, Crop Sensors and Full Frame type. The full frame sensors use to be the largest ones and they are designed to cover the full frame and they ensure larger image size even on smaller sensors. But, in case if you prefer to use a crop type sensor on your full frame camera then it will deliver an image as per size of sensor only. The idea is to avoid using smaller sensors on a large format type camera but in few special cases when you want to access certain specific look then they can be connected.</p><h4 id="3-Lens-Adapters"><a href="#3-Lens-Adapters" class="headerlink" title="3. Lens Adapters"></a>3. Lens Adapters</h4><p> If you have lens that is dedicated to work with certain specific mount type but now need to connect it on different mount then lens adapter can solve your trouble. You can find these adapters for all mount types but still there are few cons hidden behind their usage. Most of these adapters block the ability of digital communication between lenses and camera. The fact is that when you lose the digital contact then it is not possible to access autofocus feature; even the new lenses may also suffer with inability to adjust the aperture. Adapters also cause disturbance to the light that passes from lens to sensor that reduces the quality of exposure.</p><h4 id="4-Focal-Length"><a href="#4-Focal-Length" class="headerlink" title="4.Focal Length"></a>4.Focal Length</h4><p> Here is one more important factor that you need to consider while buying camera lenses. Your will find camera focal length as first most parameter listed in the specification list of the device. This length is measured on millimetres scale and when it has lower value that means you will have wider viewing angle; naturally it will capture a wide scene. When lenses have longer focal length then viewers are able to find themselves nearer to the field they are shooting. Generally, the prime lenses offer fixed focal length value but zoom lenses offer a wider range.</p><h2 id="Best-Lenses-for-4k-Camera-Professional-Production"><a href="#Best-Lenses-for-4k-Camera-Professional-Production" class="headerlink" title="Best Lenses for 4k Camera Professional Production"></a>Best Lenses for 4k Camera Professional Production</h2><p> First of all, let us collect an idea about the major differences between still and cine lenses as it will help you to make better decision.

Starting from opening titles and ending credits to transition slides and text snippets, texts and titles always enhance video content. It is quite obvious that animated texts draw more attention than showing static text effects. If you are new to video editing and text animation, you should be aware of the common types of text animation.</p><p>You should use these common text animations in your videos because the viewers are already comfortable watching them. Apart from using them directly, you should use them to create some interesting and stunning text animations so that the video looks different from others. We have listed down the common as well as interesting text animation examples for you.</p><ol><li><a href="#part1-1">Parallax scrolling</a></li><li><a href="#part1-2">Fade in and fade out</a></li><li><a href="#part1-3">Sliding text animation</a></li><li><a href="#part1-4">Text breaks away animation</a></li><li><a href="#part1-5">Typing text animation</a></li><li><a href="#part1-6">Horizontal and vertical scrolling text</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part2">8 Interesting Text Animation Examples</a></li></ul><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Morphing Text Animation</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-2">Combined Slide Out Animation</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-3">The Stomp Animation</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-4">The Curtain Animation</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-5">Animated Text Outline Effect</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-6">Animated Text Fill Effect</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-7">Neon Light Animation</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-8">In and Out of Focus Text Effect</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">How to Make a Text Animation Video</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Common-Types-of-Text-Animation"><a href="#Part-1-Common-Types-of-Text-Animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Common Types of Text Animation"></a>Part 1. Common Types of Text Animation</h2><p>Here is the list of the common types of text animations that you usually see on social media videos as well as video streaming platforms. Using these common text animation types, various interesting and innovative text animations are created.</p><h3 id="1-Parallax-scrolling"><a href="#1-Parallax-scrolling" class="headerlink" title="1. Parallax scrolling"></a>1. Parallax scrolling</h3><p>Parallax scrolling is a popular visual effect whereby the background stays the same while the foreground shifts horizontally. In a text animation, the parallax scrolling effect is where the background box moves from bottom to top and vice versa but the text stays the same all the time.</p><h3 id="2-Fade-in-and-fade-out"><a href="#2-Fade-in-and-fade-out" class="headerlink" title="2. Fade in and fade out"></a>2. Fade in and fade out</h3><p>Fade in and fade out text animation is extremely common in videos where the text slowly appears on the screen and its color brightness increase slowly. After reaching its full brightness, the text slowly loses its brightness and finally vanishes completely. Generally, the words appear and disappear simultaneously but in the modern effect, the characters appear and disappear individually at different times for more visual impact.</p><h3 id="3-Sliding-text-animation"><a href="#3-Sliding-text-animation" class="headerlink" title="3. Sliding text animation"></a>3. Sliding text animation</h3><p>You must have noticed the sliding text animation in videos where facts and figures are shown on the video. The sliding text animation generally slides into the video frame from a border or a stripe. Thereafter, it vanishes into the border or the stripe from where it originated. Sometimes, the text slides in from the right and sits in a fixed highlighted box, and slides out eventually.</p><h3 id="4-Text-breaks-away-animation"><a href="#4-Text-breaks-away-animation" class="headerlink" title="4. Text breaks away animation"></a>4. Text breaks away animation</h3><p>There are different variations of text breaks away animation but it is one of the most visually appealing text animations. That text appears on the video and it shatters and disappears. Sometimes, the text turns into dust after shattering like a glass. This text effect cum animation is highly impactful in getting the attention of the viewers immediately.</p><h3 id="5-Typing-text-animation"><a href="#5-Typing-text-animation" class="headerlink" title="5. Typing text animation"></a>5. Typing text animation</h3><p>Referred to as typewriter text animation as well, the characters in a word or sentence appear on the screen one by one as if someone is typing it in real-time. There is always a cursor blinking at the end of the character and it shifts with the appearance of the words and sentences. Instead of showing words or sentences all at once, showing text as if someone is typing it on the screen is more visually pleasing.</p><h3 id="6-Horizontal-and-vertical-scrolling-text"><a href="#6-Horizontal-and-vertical-scrolling-text" class="headerlink" title="6. Horizontal and vertical scrolling text"></a>6. Horizontal and vertical scrolling text</h3><p>Last but not least, the vertical scrolling text effect is extremely common for opening and closing credits in movies.

The animation is highly effective in getting the viewers to read the sentence and get the message.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/in-and-out-focus-text-effect.jpg"                      alt="in and out focus text effect"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-a-Text-Animation-Video"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-a-Text-Animation-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Fade in and fade out"></a>2. Fade in and fade out</h3><p>Fade in and fade out text animation is extremely common in videos where the text slowly appears on the screen and its color brightness increase slowly. After reaching its full brightness, the text slowly loses its brightness and finally vanishes completely. Generally, the words appear and disappear simultaneously but in the modern effect, the characters appear and disappear individually at different times for more visual impact.</p><h3 id="3-Sliding-text-animation-1"><a href="#3-Sliding-text-animation-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Sliding text animation"></a>3. Sliding text animation</h3><p>You must have noticed the sliding text animation in videos where facts and figures are shown on the video.

Typing text animation"></a>5. Typing text animation</h3><p>Referred to as typewriter text animation as well, the characters in a word or sentence appear on the screen one by one as if someone is typing it in real-time. There is always a cursor blinking at the end of the character and it shifts with the appearance of the words and sentences. Instead of showing words or sentences all at once, showing text as if someone is typing it on the screen is more visually pleasing.</p><h3 id="6-Horizontal-and-vertical-scrolling-text-1"><a href="#6-Horizontal-and-vertical-scrolling-text-1" class="headerlink" title="6.

    <updated>2024-07-11T18:40:02.745Z</updated>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Ultimate-Zoom-Setup-Playbook"><a href="#The-Ultimate-Zoom-Setup-Playbook" class="headerlink" title="The Ultimate Zoom Setup Playbook"></a>The Ultimate Zoom Setup Playbook</h2><p>A few weeks ago, I saw an ad for Zoom in the Charles De Gaulle airport in Paris while making a transfer from Lisbon Portugal. The first thing I thought about was how much money Zoom must be making. Even before the pandemic, Zoom was becoming a market leader in a way that GoToMeeting was previously – primarily from their awesome ease of use.</p><p>Heck, “Zoom” has even become a modern verb, as in, “Hey, let’s jump on a Zoom!”</p><p>One of the recent changes with Zoom is that videos being recorded are now announced as such when you come into the room for privacy reasons. It’s good practice to record all your Zoom meetings. I’ve been able to get testimonials from my clients by recording Zooms.</p><p>Video quality is important because you only get one chance. The source you record with cannot be upgraded in terms of quality. So, if your initial recording is poor, you’re going to be stuck with a subpar recording.</p><p>When recording, think about both your video quality, and the other Zoom participants you might want to record.</p><p>We all know and use Zoom, but there are some tricks you can use to make your videos look even better. Here are some simple tips to get a better-quality video recording from Zoom.</p><h2 id="Turn-on-HD"><a href="#Turn-on-HD" class="headerlink" title="Turn on HD"></a>Turn on HD</h2><p>HD video is disabled in Zoom by default. Obviously, HD requires more bandwidth and online space, so it’s easy to see why this is not enabled by default. So if you have not, be sure to enable HD video.</p><p>You can do that under Preferences -&gt; video. There is a button to toggle on HD. Toggle it on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/turn-on-hd-camera-zoom.jpg"                      alt="turn on hd camera zoom"                ></p><p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: periodically check that this has not been disabled when you update to new versions of Zoom.</p><h2 id="Touch-up-Your-Appearance"><a href="#Touch-up-Your-Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Touch up Your Appearance"></a>Touch up Your Appearance</h2><p>Next, under “My Video” click “touch up my appearance.” This will add a slider you can adjust to get the best picture quality. You will see your webcam in real time adjust as you toggle and play with these features.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/touch-up-my-appearance-zoom.jpg"                      alt="touch up my appearance zoom"                ></p><h2 id="Adjust-for-Low-Light"><a href="#Adjust-for-Low-Light" class="headerlink" title="Adjust for Low Light"></a>Adjust for Low Light</h2><p>Not everyone has a ring light, but nearly every scene could benefit from the low light adjustment. This uses AI technology to boost the light making a better quality recording in the vast majority of situations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/adjust-for-low-light-zoom.jpg"                      alt="adjust for low light zoom"                ></p><p>People tend to underestimate the power of good lighting in improving your video quality. Not only is brighter usually better when it comes to lighting but if you record with better light, it gives you more options for adjusting the video quality later on in post-production.</p><h2 id="Optimize-Video-Quality"><a href="#Optimize-Video-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Optimize Video Quality"></a>Optimize Video Quality</h2><p>Under the advanced settings, there is a toggle called “Optimize video quality with de-noise.” Make sure this is toggled on. This uses AI software-based noise removal to help improve the video quality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/optimize-video-quality-zoom.jpg"                      alt="optimize video quality zoom"                ></p><h2 id="Use-a-USB-mic"><a href="#Use-a-USB-mic" class="headerlink" title="Use a USB mic"></a>Use a USB mic</h2><p>Have you ever seen a video with really poor sound quality? It makes a huge difference in how you judge the quality of that video. So if you have a USB mic, use that instead of the built-in microphone. Viewers will subconsciously judge the quality of the video not only on video quality, but also on sound quality. It makes a massive difference to the final video recording.</p><h2 id="Use-a-Virtual-Background"><a href="#Use-a-Virtual-Background" class="headerlink" title="Use a Virtual Background"></a>Use a Virtual Background</h2><p>A cluttered background is never ideal in videos. That’s why the rage on YouTube is to use a camera (Like the Canon M50 for example) that naturally provides a bokeh effect, which is a gentle blurring of the background.</p><p>The reason this is so critical is it helps the viewer focus on what is important - which is your speaker.</p><p>So Under “Backgrounds &amp; Effects” choose a virtual background, or the “blur” option to help improve your source video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/use-virtual-background-zoom.jpg"                      alt="use virtual background zoom"                ></p><h2 id="Be-aware-of-the-different-views-during-your-meeting"><a href="#Be-aware-of-the-different-views-during-your-meeting" class="headerlink" title="Be aware of the different views during your meeting"></a>Be aware of the different views during your meeting</h2><p>Zoom records with a single video file, unlike other software options such as Ecamm or Skype Call Recorder. This means the recording will be very similar to what you see.</p><p>When you are in a meeting, you can toggle between the Gallery view, which shows everyone in the meeting in tiles, and the Speaker view, which shows the main speaker in a full-screen mode.</p><p>The recording will record exactly what is on the screen, so if you want to get some variety, you can toggle between these two during your recording.</p><p>There is also a “Highlight” feature where you can manually select a participant to be highlighted regardless if they are the active speaker or not.</p><p>Here’s another tip. You can choose to hide the participants who don’t have a video stream by adjusting one of the video settings Check “Hide non-video participants.”</p><h2 id="Wipe-your-webcam"><a href="#Wipe-your-webcam" class="headerlink" title="Wipe your webcam"></a>Wipe your webcam</h2><p>Webcams can pick up dust and oil from time to time. So before important recordings (and also because my kids sometimes use my laptop) I usually wipe my webcam with a lint-free microfiber cloth before important Zooms with my colleagues and clients.</p><p>I use the same type of cloth that I use for cleaning my eyeglasses. Keep it simple and clean!</p><h2 id="Upgrade-your-camera"><a href="#Upgrade-your-camera" class="headerlink" title="Upgrade your camera"></a>Upgrade your camera</h2><p>You can add a better webcam or even a mirrorless camera, like the Canon M50 that is popular with YouTubers as a webcam input. Once you have added the camera, you can select which webcam you want to use from the dropdown menu.</p><h2 id="Organize-your-Zooms"><a href="#Organize-your-Zooms" class="headerlink" title="Organize your Zooms"></a>Organize your Zooms</h2><p>If you do use your Zooms in your video editing, I would recommend renaming the video file or Zoom folder after your meeting. This doesn’t affect the video quality, but it sure allows the experience of video editing to go much smoother when you know exactly which file you are looking for.</p><h2 id="Final-bonus-tip"><a href="#Final-bonus-tip" class="headerlink" title="Final bonus tip"></a>Final bonus tip</h2><p>Remember, bring energy to what you say. Good energy will raise the quality of ANY video recording. It doesn’t matter if you are giving a lecture, teaching on your Zoom, or giving a sales pitch.

This desktop program can change your live voice to match your desired online character, whether voice chatting on Skype and Discord or playing on Steam and Valorant. But if you’re looking to use MorphVOX, it’s paramount to know that this program comes in two packages, the Junior and Pro versions. So, what’s the difference between the Junior and Pro versions? Let’s find out!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try AI Voice Changer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try AI Voice Changer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-MorphVOX-Junior-voice-changer"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-MorphVOX-Junior-voice-changer" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

What is MorphVOX Junior voice changer?</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://screamingbee.com/morphvox-free-voice-changer" >MorphVOX Junior <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a free, open-source voice changer for Windows systems. This voice changer is optimized for online gaming or pranking your friends on video and voice chats on apps like Skype, Meet Now, Zoom, and more.</p><p>You only need to select it as your input microphone to use it. MorphVOX Junior will enable you to convert your voice into a man, woman, or Tiny Folks. You can also customize your voice with background sound effects like an alarm clock, screech, cuckoo, and more.</p><p>However, this voice changer is best suited for entertainment than serious-business voice changing. That’s because it’s pretty basic in terms of everything. For example, you only get three voices and four sound effects. Other than that, it’s an excellent free voice changer to have on your computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/morphvox-voice-changer-1.jpg"                      alt="morphvox voice changer junior"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-What-is-MorphVOX-Pro-voice-changer"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-MorphVOX-Pro-voice-changer" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

What is MorphVOX Pro voice changer?</h2><p>If you’re unsatisfied with MorphVOX Junior, purchase <a class="link"   href="https://screamingbee.com/morphvox-voice-changer" >MorphVOX Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for $39.99 only. Unlike the Junior version, this voice changer is compatible with macOS and Windows systems. It’s super easy to set up and is compatible with a range of desktop apps, including CS:GO, Skype, Discord, and more.</p><p>But the Junior version doesn’t come close when it comes to voice-changing capabilities. MorphVOX Pro will change your voice into tens of active voices, including a man, woman, robot, demon, droid, child, and more. You can even download more voice effects directly on the software.</p><p>Meanwhile, you can beautify your voice further using the multi-band graphic equalizer. Also, this professional voice changer boasts effective noise reduction and voice comparison capabilities. Voice parsing detection and stereo microphone are also supported. And yes, you can record the morphed voice and morph local sound files. All in all, this voice changer is worth every penny.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/morphvox-voice-changer-2.jpg"                      alt="morphvox voice changer pro"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-use-MorphVOX-voice-changer"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-use-MorphVOX-voice-changer" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

In this tutorial, we’ll learn how to use MorphVOX Junior to change voices on Discord. For those who don’t know, Discord is an instant messaging and VoIP app where users can share voice calls, video calls, media, and text messages. Although it’s compatible with Linux, Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android, we’ll learn how to use it on Windows PC. Now follow me!</p><p>Step1 Assuming you already have a Discord account, head straight to Screamingbee.com and install MorphVOX Junior.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/morphvox-voice-changer-3.jpg"                      alt="download morphvox voice changer junior"                ></p><p>Step2 Once the app is up and running, head to Discord and click the <strong>User Settings</strong> icon at the bottom of the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/morphvox-voice-changer-4.jpg"                      alt="morphvox voice changer junior open discord settings"                ></p><p>Step3 Then, tap <strong>Voice &amp; Video</strong> before choosing the <strong>Input Device</strong> as <strong>Screaming Bee Audio</strong>. You can also adjust <strong>Input Sensitivity</strong> by disabling the feature and then speak to your mic to change the sensitivity accordingly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/morphvox-voice-changer-5.jpg"                      alt="morphvox voice changer junior choose discord input"                ></p><p>Step4 Lastly, head to MorphVOX voice changer and choose a magic voice.

You can capture stills at 12MP capabilities where touch sensitive display makes everything much easier to access. If you start shooting at 1080p then GoPro Killer will offer you advanced stabilization abilities. This device is well known for its excellent battery life and you can buy it at reasonable price range. But the sad part is that it lacks somewhere in audio recording abilities and also cannot be used underwater. So if you are an adventure sports lover then you must check for any other option.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"
