## Critique on Luminance’s Approach to HDR Creation

Creating HDR images ‘High Dynamic Range Images' involves combining several narrow range images with multiple exposures. And as we all know, digital cameras can only capture images with differentiation in a specific range of luminosity.

You need reliable HDR software to be able to create HDR images. Luminance HDR is one of the top software that many people want to have at their fingertips. But is the tool worth it? Does it have all it takes to satisfy your HDR image creation and editing needs? Well, this post has the right answers to these questions and lots more. So, stick around to find out more.

## Part 1: Summary Box on Luminance HDR

Luminance HDR is a digital graphics software that is used for the creation and editing of ‘High Dynamic Range Images. Formerly known as Qtpfsgui, this tool is a free and open-source program that not only facilitates the workflow for HDR imaging but also LDR imaging.

**Effectiveness:** Highly effective, but with some confusing features.

**Price:** Free

**Supported OS:** Windows, Mac OS, Linux

**Ease to use:** 3.5/5

**Best for:** Creating and editing HDR images

**Value for Money:** The tool is free

**Support:** 0/5

**Our Verdict:** Luminance HDR is a very effective HDR software with a wide range of functionalities.

The tool boasts up to six photo blending algorithms for users to take advantage of in a fairly responsive interface.

It supports a wide range of decent features ranging from alignment to deghosting, EV-based histogram, and lots more. But the only thing is some features are confusing, making it quite challenging.

Also, enabling features like ‘alignment and deghosting could cause the program to crash.

**What we like**

* High compatibility with both Mac and Windows computers.
* Allows Batch HDR merging.

**What we don't like**

HDR expands the range of contrasts and color of images significantly. Thus, making bright sides brighter and colors become expanded so every detail of the images would be seen without stress.

Besides, there are various HDR formats including Dolby vision, generic, and lots more. It is even used in TVs to enrich colors with content that supports it.

Since HDR photography requires a narrow range of digital images with multiple exposures, it's essential you have the right HDR software at your fingertips to be able to calculate the high contrast image, combine the images, and do lots more efficiently.

That being said, let's dive into a detailed review on Luminance HDR to find out more about how the tool can help users in their endeavors to create/edit HDR images

## Part 2: Review in detail on Luminance HDR

Luminance HDR software is a free tool and it offers users a simple way to create and edit HDR images efficiently. It identifies data correctly and it supports lots of decent features that users can take advantage of when executing HDR image editing or creation tasks.

In the current development after almost two years, Luminance HDR has optimized different aspects to fix bugs, enhance its speed, and lots more. Some new developments introduced include a better CLI interface, better HDPI support, automatic adjustments of LDRs levels, a new Dark theme, and fast export.

We've outlined some of the features of Luminance HDR below;

1. HDR Editing

In terms of editing, you can rely on Luminance HDR for cool editing features that can always come in handy when you're looking to edit HDR images. From resizing to cropping, rotating, etc. Keep reading to know more about the editing featured on Luminance HDR.

1. HDR Processing

Luminance HDR separates the processing of HDR images into two phases: The creation of HDR images and its conversion to an LDR image. The creation and tone mapping of HDR images are interactive using GUI, and images can be enhanced using quality features. The image loading speed is quite fair. So, in all, we could say the Luminance HDR processing is reliable.

1. UI and Layout

Also, you can utilize ‘Portable' mode to put the Luminous HDR application on a USB stick with its settings.
