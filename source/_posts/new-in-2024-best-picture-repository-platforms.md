The photo hosting services are gaining much popularity these days and you can easily find so many sites providing such kind of services. There are so many factors to consider while making selection for a suitable photo hosting site because few features can make huge difference in performance. Below we are going to discuss five major things about good photo hosting sites:

* **Shareability:** We all love to share our memories with friends on social media sites like Twitter and Facebook. So a good photo storage site must be capable enough to assist in easy sharing needs.
* **Ease of Access:** It must be able to find images with reference to their dates, added tags or other relevant details.
* **Ease of Use:** One must be capable enough to upload images with ease and editing tasks must be interactive.
* **Quality:** All stills on Photo hosting platforms must be preserved with their original quality. It should not compress images unnecessarily.
* **Space and Price:** One must be able to manage this storage space at low cost.
