## Part 1: How Do I Choose a Camera

There are hundreds of cameras available to choose from. How do you know which one is going to be right for your purposes? Here’s a quick look at some of the most important traits that you’ll want to keep an eye out for during your search.

* **Portability**: If you want to make sure that you can take your camera with you everywhere, then a simple point and click option may be perfect for what you’re looking for. While these typically have a fixed lens, the technology for these cameras have gotten a lot better at providing flexibility and excellent results, as well. In many cases, beginners benefit from using a simple [point-and-click camera](https://www.digitaltrends.com/photography/best-point-and-shoot-cameras/) at first.
* **Budget**: You always want to be sure that you look at price when you’re looking at beginner cameras. More often than not, you’re going to want to get something that is relatively affordable without sacrificing quality. You may not know whether or not you want to pursue this whole picture and video hobby, and a cheaper camera will make it easier to sell if you find it’s not for you.
* **Lenses**: If you’re someone that is looking to step into something a little more complicated, you may also want the flexibility to [switch out the lenses](https://lifehacker.com/the-fastest-way-to-change-lenses-on-your-dslr-1191321251) that you’re using. Point and click cameras typically don’t have this capability, but you can still find some reasonably affordable options that allow for you to switch lenses in and out.

### 4\. [Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark II Mirrorless Camera](https://www.amazon.com/Olympus-Mirrorless-Camera-14-42mm-Silver/dp/B01CIXJSOK/ref=sr%5F1%5F5?crid=1P1YSTDMUHBWL&keywords=olympus+om-d+e-m10+mark+iii&qid=1583897552&sprefix=Olympus+OM-D+E-M10+Mark+II%2Caps%2C461&sr=8-5)

### 1\. Is Canon or Nikon better for beginners?

In all honesty, it depends on what you’re looking for. Similar models are similarly priced, which makes a choice all the more difficult. Both Canon and Nikon make beginner level cameras – the T7i and the D5600, respectively.

The T7i has a better sensor and ends up being much lighter than the Canon model. But, on the other hand, the shooting FPS and the number of autofocus points are better on the [Nikon D5600](https://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/product/dslr-cameras/d5600.html). So, if you have some preferences related to what you’re shooting or how you want to shoot it, you’ll want to choose one over the other.

### 2\. What should I know before buying a camera?

You need to ask a few questions listed below before purchase a camera.

* Do you want a prime lens or a zoom lens?
* Do you have a budget in place?
* What sort of memory card will you need to get?
* [What kind of microphone do you need](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)? Internal, external, or no microphone?
* What watermark will you use when you share your pictures online?
* Will you be doing any night photography, and, if so, is that camera right for the purpose?
* Where is the tripod socket, and how large of a tripod do you need?
* Does the flash come with it, or do you need to buy a separate one?

## Conclusion

If you’re looking for the best camera for beginners, you want to be sure that you do your research and work out precisely what you need to do. In the end, you’ll find what’s best for you and how you want to start taking pictures and videos well.
