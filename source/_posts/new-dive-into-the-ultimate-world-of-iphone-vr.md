Incell is a game where players can approach bioscience as a whole new game experience. Incell simulates what it would be like to be shrunk down into the human body.

Lamper is a game all about a firefly. If you love runner experiences like temple run, this is a VR title that you are going to really enjoy.

## 4.[End space VR](https://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/end-space-vr-for-cardboard/id1056999701?mt=8)

End space is a shooter that is built specifically for use with VR. Using the trigger buttons on the side of your VR headset you can fire weapons and have space battles by guiding your ship with hade based movements. 3-D positioned audio and top quality VR graphics ensure that this space shooter is action packed.

There are plenty of upgrades for the ships and great sound with this game but with never ending style gameplay it does get old quite quickly.
