The “Collective” tab also features some of the best memes created and posted recently, but it offers you the chance to search for the memes, GIFs, photos, and videos using various categories. This is the best option when looking for a very specific GIF.

The “Subscribe” tab is useful when you want to engage with other users on the app. Here, you will also find options to chat with other uses, like and comment on their memes

The “Explore” tab lists all the mems on the platform, neatly arranged in various categories. Since the content is user generated, there is no limit to the memes that you can find and download.
