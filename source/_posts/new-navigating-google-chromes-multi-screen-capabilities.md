Picture in Picture allows you to watch videos while using other apps on your device. However, you may face challenges while using PIP on your computers. Both hand mobile phones and desktop computers may draw concerns with executing Picture-in-Picture because of different reasons.

Sometimes you may face difficulties when PIP is just disabled on YouTube, so correct this with three simple steps on your YouTube App.

1. Open **YouTube**
2. Go to **Settings > General**
3. Verify if Picture-in-Picture is disabled to enable this PIP feature on your phone.

Another concern comes when PIP is not available in your country. There are two ways to solve this. Using a web browser or VPN. Chrome enables you to use PIP even in countries where it is not enabled.

4. As the video starts to play, tap the **Home button** on your device.
