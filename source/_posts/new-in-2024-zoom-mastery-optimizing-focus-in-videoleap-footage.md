## Zoom Mastery: Optimizing Focus in VideoLeap Footage

Video editing applications are becoming very popular these days because of their usage in many daily life scenarios. Whether you are a professional or just a normal user who wants to add perfection to video recordings, the video platforms provide easy solutions. And one such easy-to-use and installed video editor is the Videoleap. But how to zoom in on Videoleap?

This application has a dozen categories of functions such as filters, effects, adjustments of lights and colors, and many more to add a cinematic look to videos. One such function present in the Videoleap platform is the zoom function that lets users zoom into certain areas of the video screen. This tool in Videoleap can be greatly used as a means to put any subject on focus or can help in reducing irrelevant sections of the video.

## How to static Zoom in Videoleap

Videoleap is famous for providing the best video editing features to its users and because of its lightweight design, there are millions of its users around the world. And from its different tools, zoom is a great function that can be used as a focus tool or can be used as a transition effect. Static zoom-in Videoleap refers to the zoom-in of the screen contents for a particular video in a jump-in or jump-out format. And in case you are wondering how, you can edit your videos with the Videoleap application by applying a static zoom, here is how you can do it:

* First, open the Videoleap interface on your device and then import the video clips that you want to edit. This import will save your video clips under a project which you can access at any time you want.
* Another way to import any clips to your project is by clicking on the "+" icon and then selecting the desired file from your camera roll.

![tap add media videoleap](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/tap-add-media-videoleap.jpg)

* Now after the video clips are imported and collected, you will see a timeline of clips where everything will be arranged to your initial preferences.

![video timeline videoleap](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/video-timeline-videoleap.jpg)

* Click on the part of the timeline that you want to edit and then select the tool that says "Transform". This tool is usually present at the bottom of your screen.

![transform vdieo videoleap](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/transform-vdieo-videoleap.jpg)

* Now play the video after zooming in by clicking on the "play" button and check whether the zoom effect has been added to your video project or not.
* After you are satisfied, save the project and export it at your preference to your computer.

## How to Animate the Zoom effect in Videoleap

Sometimes the video contents need a dramatic zoom effect that should take place while the video is still playing. And this is called an animated zoom in the Videoleap application. In other words, using the animated zoom effect in Videoleap, you will be able to zoom into your footage. And a major way to apply this effect is by considering the keyframes of the raw footage. These keyframes help the users by animating a zoom effect while there is a movement taking place in the video. And if you also want to animate the zoom effect in Videoleap, here is how you can do it:

* Open the Videoleap application and click on the "+" icon to import files to the application interface. Then you will be available with the video file on a timeline that you want to edit.
* Now, drag the play head on the timeline where you want to start the zoom effect to take place.

![preview timeline videoleap](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/preview-timeline-videoleap.jpg)

* Then select the "keyframes" tool from the toolbar at the bottom of your screen.
* Add the keyframes to the desired portion of the video and then navigate the timecode to the place on the timeline where you want to stop it. After that add another keyframe at that point and pinch in to zoom the video.

![add keyframes videoleap](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-keyframes-videoleap.jpg)

* Now head to the second time code where you want to focus the subject and then click on it. Then click on the "Preview" icon and see whether it needs further changes.
* When you are satisfied, simply export the project and your animated zoom video will be saved successfully.
