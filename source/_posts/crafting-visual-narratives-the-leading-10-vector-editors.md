## Crafting Visual Narratives: The Leading 10 Vector Editors

If you have ever been interested in graphic design, you must have heard of the term "**vector images"** before. These are commonly used in logo design, with images made of curves, lines, and points that come together based on a mathematical formula to form vibrant and non-pixelated digital artwork.

If you plan to create branded digital logos, you should know what they are and their difference from raster images. Here, we will discuss that specifically, including the types and software options to help create stunning ones. Let's get started.

![vector image vs zoomed in image in bitmap image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/beginners-guide-to-all-things-vector-images-overview-types-and-software-choices-1.jpg)

## Part I. The Art of Vector Images

Understanding what you will deal with in the name of **vector images** should be the first step. That is precisely what we will discuss here, beginning with what stands for vector as a picture format.

### What are Vector Images?

A vector image is a graphics-based file format made of a group of points with lines to join them. The vector drawing program's point-to-point illustration helps create complex and straightforward line-based geometric shapes. Therefore, when you see the images, it looks smoother and barely pixelated when zoomed into the image.

Users can add gradients and solid color within the shapes, and all of its information, like the point coordination and how the shape is filled, is stored via mathematical equations. In graphic design, the computer uses mathematical data to render the vector image. For this, it connects the "Paths" (lines) and fills within the shape with color.

Currently, many professional editors use top-quality **software to create vector images** for digital objects with optimized geometrical precision. It is commonly used in areas like typography, 3D rendering, and engineering, all of which require software that can decompose complex data into simplified geometric primitives.

The common types of these images that graphic designers and other professionals work with now are WMF, SVG, EPS, CDR, PDF, or AI-based graphic files. But most people deal with raster images, so they do not have some confusion about what vector files are.

| **WHAT IS**       | Bitmap or Vector images are arranged in a grid pattern of multi-colored pixels to form an image.Examples include BMP, GIF, APNG, JPEG/JPG, MPEG4, and WebP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Vector images are a graphical type of image format which is made of geometric shapes on a type of cartesian place, including elements like curves, lines, points, and polygons.Examples include WMF, SVG, EPS, CDR, and PDF.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **PROS**          | 1\. The images are easier to produce and distribute across platforms, devices, and other conventional input-output devices, like scanners, inkjet printers, etc.2\. It is compatible with different types of image types, like posters to small badges.3\. These have very high processing speeds.4\. Users can create different types of images without any concern about complexity. | 1\. Best for graphic design artwork, like branded logos and documents.2\. When you zoom the images, there are no noticeable pixels and the image still looks smooth.3\. When you try to decrease or increase a digitized object, the lines with pre-specified width is not controlled as per the image size.4\. It is easier to scale, move, or rotate the vector images without affecting image quality. |
| **CONS**          | 1\. It only looks natural when seeing the images on a small scale or from far. When zoomed, the pictures look pixelated and rougher.2\. Blurry appearance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 1\. Showing the image in low resolution has a different level of quality.2\. Only some graphic types will look good in vector file format.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
