 Oct 26, 2023• Proven solutions

Now, live streamers have multiple functions as well as customization tools for making broadcasts to attract engagements and monetize across various social media platforms. Popular platforms linked to the OBS Streamlabs Mac are Twitch, YouTube, Facebook, Mixer, and any other desirable streaming option. The possibilities are limitless. Surely, with this new development, OBS Streamlabs Mac can match close competitors such as the original OBS, ECamm live, and Twitch Studios.

Subsequently, we will go through the workings of the OBS Streamlabs Mac from download and onwards but, first, it is important to know all about this brilliant Open Broadcast Software and what makes it endearing.

## Streamlabs OBS vs OBS

The generic OBS is a software put out to the general public to enable streaming in its simplest and unmodified form. For an individual that just wants to stream videos without colorfulness, effects, and additional features, the OBS is perfect.

However, Streamlabs OBS is improved. Known as SLOBS to its increasing subscribers, Streamlabs OBS enhances user experience and provides a collection of tools to do so in one hub, with no outsourcing.

* OBS (Open Broadcaster Studio)

It is free and open-source, the code is 'naked' to the public. At will, developers can improve on the software. Manual connection to Twitch, YouTube, and the likes is also possible. A few settings here and there and you are set!

OBS gives a wonderful experience to users albeit with its inefficiencies in providing added features and functions. It is seamless as far as primary recording and broadcasting are concerned, leaving out the extras.

There are overlays and background designs available on OBS for a price although limited. Largely, users will need to consult other websites—copy and paste—to have varied layout options. It is not much work, however; there are many such websites.

* Streamlabs OBS

This is an example of when life gives you lemons, make lemonade. Streamlabs saw an opportunity with the original OBS and like any other developer, modified it. They have forged on everyone till this OBS Streamlab Mac version. The code was revamped to guarantee an improved user experience.

Like OBS, OBS Streamlabs Mac is free with a relatively easier installation process. Preceding the OBS Streamlabs Mac, it was available only on Windows and had app versions on Android and iOS. Notwithstanding, through Bootcamp, Mac owners could switch operating systems and use StreamLabs OBS.

In a blink, all settings are pre-configured and subscribers are directed to the Dashboard where major choices are made. After a few clicks, you are set to stream.

OBS Streamlabs Mac's enhanced experience is by far unmatched by any other of its kind. An array of themes and advanced features allows each user to create his world through personalized—unique—layouts.
