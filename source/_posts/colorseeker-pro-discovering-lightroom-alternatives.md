This tool is the most powerful editor to empower your clicks and help you to capture and edit the best shots of yours.

#### 1\. Some features are lacking

This tool still has to proceed with Lightroom Classic in some of the areas.

#### 2\. Lightroom classic vs. lightroom

Users still for the most advanced projects of editing need to pick the Classic version over the normal one.

#### 3\. Compositing

We find that currently, the capacity of compositing of the lightroom is a bit limited in merging the panoramic scenes.
