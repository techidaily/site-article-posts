## How to Make Keen Funny Ringtones?

If you disapprove of the funny ringtones available on the sites mentioned above, create your own funny tones by converting YouTube videos to MP3 format using [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Filmora is a user-friendly video editor and very affordable. It has various features, including Audio Detach, [Silence Detection](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), [Audio Ducking](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and so on.

Then, launch the software and click **“Import”** to add two funny video songs to create a Keen funny ringtone.

Step2 Next, drag the files to the **“Timeline Panel.”** Now, right-click the video files and select **“Detach Audio”** to extract funny audio from videos, which will show on the audio track.

![detach audio filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/detach-audio-filmora.PNG)

Step3 Now right-click only that song whose silent parts you want to delete and select **“Silence Detection.”** A window will open with three parameters; **“Threshold,” “Minimum Silence,” and “Buffer,”** which you can adjust manually or by clicking **“Start”** to perform silence detection automatically.

Step6 In the end, click **“Create”** and hit the **“Export”** button to save the ringtone on your PC. Lastly, if you’re not using a mobile device, transfer the newly made funny ringtone to your phone using a USB cable or sync the file with a cloud service.
