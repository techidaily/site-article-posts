If you disapprove of the funny ringtones available on the sites mentioned above, create your own funny tones by converting YouTube videos to MP3 format using [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Filmora is a user-friendly video editor and very affordable. It has various features, including Audio Detach, [Silence Detection](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), [Audio Ducking](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and so on.

Step1 In the first step, download the latest software version of Filmora. However, if you’re using an Android or iOS device, download the app from the [**Play Store**](https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6) or [**App Store**](https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6).

Then, launch the software and click **“Import”** to add two funny video songs to create a Keen funny ringtone.

Step2 Next, drag the files to the **“Timeline Panel.”** Now, right-click the video files and select **“Detach Audio”** to extract funny audio from videos, which will show on the audio track.

![detach audio filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/detach-audio-filmora.PNG)

Step3 Now right-click only that song whose silent parts you want to delete and select **“Silence Detection.”** A window will open with three parameters; **“Threshold,” “Minimum Silence,” and “Buffer,”** which you can adjust manually or by clicking **“Start”** to perform silence detection automatically.

Step6 In the end, click **“Create”** and hit the **“Export”** button to save the ringtone on your PC. Lastly, if you’re not using a mobile device, transfer the newly made funny ringtone to your phone using a USB cable or sync the file with a cloud service.
