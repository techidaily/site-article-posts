### 2\. Motion Tracking  

Motion Tracking is available in Filmora 11 and is really beautiful!  
Motion tracking is to track the movement in your video, a person, hand, or even a scenery. Once the movement has been tracked you can add text or images or other objects to follow the same movement.

I would show you how to keyframe your video in a simple way.  
Let’s get started!

* Double-click on the clip to open up the **edit menu**.
* Go to the **animation tab** from the menu at the top and select **customize tab**.
