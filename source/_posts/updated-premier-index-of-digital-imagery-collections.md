## 5\. Snappa

![snappa](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/10-sites-to-get-free-images-05.JPG)

Snappa is one of my favorite sites for free images because it's easy to navigate, has a wide selection of photos and graphics, and doesn't require attribution or watermarks.

The site has an extensive library of free stock photos, vectors, mockups, and templates categorized by industry (e.g., technology), scene (e.g., cityscapes), and more.

It can be a little hard to find exactly what you're looking for as there are so many options; if you have trouble finding what you want in Snappa's search engine, try clicking on one of the categories listed above to narrow it down some more.

## 6\. Freerange

## 10\. CC Search

![cc search](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/10-sites-to-get-free-images-10.JPG)

CC Search is a search engine for Creative Commons photos, which means you can use the images on your website without paying anything. CC Search has an extensive collection of images to choose from, and they are all free. Just type your keyword in the search bar, and you'll find plenty of relevant results.

You can also choose whether you want to display ads on your site. If you want to keep them off completely, there is an option that allows users who visit your site to download high-resolution copies at no cost (as long as they attribute credit).

## Conclusion

And that's it! I hope these sites help you find the perfect image for your project.
